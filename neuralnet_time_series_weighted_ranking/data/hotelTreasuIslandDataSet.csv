There were only 4 check in clerks (working very slowly) to check in over a hundred customers. There was no appology, in fact we were treated rudley and then told our rooms would not be ready for several hours and this is after waiting in line all this time. When we asked why it owuld be so long for our suites to be ready, we were just told &quot;Hey as long as someone is gambling, we won't kick them out&quot; We then placed our baggage in hold where we told them there was insulin that need to be kept cold (it was not placed in a cool place and ruined) We were here on business as well as pleasure. After the long wait at the hotel and no time to change clothes or EAT, we hurried off to our meeting which we were way to late for and missed the MAIN reason we came to Las Vegas for! I have never written a complaint for a hotel or anything else on line and THIS DESERVED TO BE MY FIRST!<br/>You know I would have thought that at least the hotel would have sent a fruit basket to one of the suites I had booked or at least had said sorry for your wait, but NOPE!	3	-1	-1	-1	4	1	-1	3

This has not just been painful but I needed professional medical treatment for months. I was moved to a different room on a smoking floor for the night before I could fly back and a phone and reference number to contact Treasure Island's Crisis Management. I called several times and my case was still under review and was promised that someone would get back to me what never happened. Finally I had to hire an attorney to represent my interest and I am willing to go to court, if necessary.<br/>Stefan Schultheis, Germany.	1	4	-1	1	1	1	-1	1

Had to wait an hour or so in line just to check in. There were only 4 staff at the check in counter. A very busy hotel. It would be nice to have a coffee making amenity in the room.

Treasure Island is in a great location, not too far on either end of the strip and within walking distance to anything you want to see on the strip if you are ok with the heat. The rooms are very nice, checking in was pleasant, and the pool area is very nice as well. Free internet in the rooms and use of the gym was great. My partner and I decided to pay less for a hotel to spend money on shows/dinners, etc. so we did get a good deal on Treasure Island and I would definitely recommend it, however i would not stay here again just because I would want to try out a different hotel. I also am not very fond of the &quot;atmosphere&quot; in the casino, my partner and I prefer something more high-energy, but it does have a poker room that is rarely crowded. I think that we stayed in the most basic/cheapest room you can book and it was very nice.	3	4	-1	3	4	3	-1	5

What a dissapointment. 21st birthday present for my child, and was treated rudely by staff at Gilley's, The Coffee Shop, and the hotel staff. Quote was I don't care if I ever go back to Vegas, and ahead of the house at that. My second trip there, and I can'e even mark it up to someone having a bad day. Multiple pepole having bad days on the same day. Management needs to get the situation under control, are they are going to be part of the continued downturn in Vegas. Never again at TI. Got stuck with the worthless &quot;resort fee&quot; as well.	1	-1	-1	-1	3	1	-1	2

We were given 3 rooms on the same floor all with fantastic views looking down the strip to Paris and the Bellagio, room was imaculate with possibly the most comftable bed i have ever slept in. Good food downstairs and more importantly excellent strawberry daquiri's from the bar!

We paid $57/night CAD from hotels.ca plus we were surprised with a $22.50/night US resort fee upon check in. The resort fee grants access to the gym, wifi, local &amp; toll free calls, boarding pass printing, $20 off a future stay.<br/>The location of the hotel is great. Right across from the Venetian, Wynn and next to the Mirage. We bought a 3day pass for the Deuce (bus that runs along the strip) for $20. Really came in handy.<br/>The pool was nice, not very clean by 2pm. A lot of people drinking and partying in the pool. We had just stayed at the Wynn 2 night earlier and what a difference in clientele. Wynn was a very classy pool (people and the pool itself) whereas TI was more of a party atmosphere. <br/>Overall good place to stay for the price and location.	4	-1	-1	-1	3	3	-1	4

Like many reviews on this site, yes the check-in line was long. But not unbearable. Remember that most hotels in Vegas have 2000-5000 rooms, you should expect to wait to check-in! The guy who checked us in was pretty cool, and very welcoming. We requested a smoking room, but they were doing upgrades on some of the smoking rooms, so he upgraded us to a smoking room on the 36th floor (penthouse view) with a great view of the strip. After being in Vegas many times, a view was not essential, but was greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>The room was really nice. 14 ft cielings, flat screen TV - and the most comfortable beds we've ever slept on. There were some postings about hearing noise from the neighbours - we never heard a thing. <br/><br/>They do have a resort fee of $22.40 (incl tax) per day. We already new about this before we went (plus people complain about it all over this site). It is a little pricey, but we were able to use a laptop in the room, which was great. also includes free local and toll-free calls. We got a great deal on the room, so $20 bucks extra per day was no big deal. <br/><br/>Housekeeping was attentive and did a good job. One and only complaint about that - one day they knocked on the door at 8:30am. No big deal, as we were awake, but some people may not want service that early.<br/><br/>We had the buffet for lunch on our last day, as we had a 2-for-1 coupon. The food was good, and lots of selection. We've eaten at their Mexican themed restaurant &quot;ISLA&quot; before, so thought we would try it again. The menu changed a bit, but was still really good. With our $50 food credit, our meal only cost $13 bucks!<br/><br/>For the gamblers - did not have a ton of luck at TI casino. Had one good night, winning about $400, but thats about it! But hey... thats why they call it gambling!<br/><br/>Went to &quot;Tix for Tonight&quot; and got half price tickets for Mystere Cirque Du Soleil, at TI - great show. I'm not easily impressed but this show was awesome. I reccomend seeing it.<br/><br/>The pool is not huge compared to others i've seen in Vegas, but it did the job. It was a necessity, since temps soared to 107 degrees while we were there! Tip - it gets busy quickly, so grab your seats early! They played a good selection of music at the pool, so i didn't need my ipod.<br/><br/>We rented a car one day and went to the Hoover Dam again. Visited a few outlet malls outside Las Vegas. We have found that this is key when in Vegas. You need to get away from the hustle and bustle for a while.<br/><br/>All in all - we enjoyed our stay at Treasure Island. Don't believe all the &quot;bad&quot; reviews on here. I've learned that people are nit-picky and have nothing better to do than post a bad review of hotels. Give TI a shot. We did, and it was worth it.	4	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	5

On arrival we were told we couldn't have the room we booked and that bookings weren't guaranteed until arrival. We were offered a swap the next day between 12 and 3- not what we wanted to spend our holiday time doing or at the hotels convenience not ours. Food was average, service slow and poor. Prices ludicrous for everything- expect to pay at least double. We drove 2 mins away for food at reasonable prices. We had to ask for hand towels and flannels as there were none in the room. Water did not drain properly from sink or bath. TV was tiny. Staff were rude.	2	3	-1	2	3	2	-1	-1

Even after you add in the $25 PER DAY &quot;resort fee&quot; which I hate, and is just plain sneaky, it was a pretty good value. The hotel was clean and comfortable. We had a couple of really good meals at Isla, the Mexican restaurant in the hotel. Probably not going back to Vegas anytime soon, but I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if I did.	4	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	4

Overall it was a good experience. Our check-in was great. No long lines. However, we arrived at 10pm. We did notice long lines on a couple of occassions, usually late afternoon. I cannot say how fast the lines moved, though. The front desk people were quite nice and helpful. One issue we had was we requested our room be next to or close to my sister-in-law's room (this was done when we made our original reservation). Not only were the rooms not on the same floor, due to the set up of elevators, we had to take an elevator to the ground level to get on another elevator to go to their room. An inconvinience but not a deal breaker. We usually just met at the elevators on the ground floor.<br/><br/>The rooms were clean, nice and spacious. The bed was comfortable (a little soft for my tastes but my wife loved it). Plenty of room in the bathroom. Only one sink. Again, not a huge issue just a minor inconvinience. As stated in several reviews, there is not refrigerator or microwave. However, styrofoam coolers are plentiful in town. If you want beverages, just go to the Walgreen's across the street to get a cooler.<br/><br/>Both of our rooms faced the strip, overlooking the pirate show. The show could be heard from our rooms, especially when the cannons went off. This was not a bother to us, just want people to be aware that there will be some noise.<br/><br/>We had mixed feelings on the restaurants in T.I. We arrived late on Wed and decided to eat at Gilley's. As we were walking in, a couple told us that it was the best food they had while in Vegas. They had eaten at Gilley's a couple of times and that the short ribs and the mac &amp; cheese were the best. We all thought the mac &amp; cheese was very good. I had the ribs and was a little disappointed. They were a little dry. Good flavor, though. My brother-in-law had a burger but was not overly impressed. Not a restaurant I would go out of my way for.<br/><br/>Kahunaville was our favorite restaurant. Not because the food was great (it was above average) but because they push coupons. Anywhere to save a buck. We ate dinner there once and breakfast twice. They have a fruit plate for $10 that will feed four people. The fruit was fresh. The strawberries were fantastic, the cantaloupe was sweet as was the honeydew melon. It had watermelon, grapes and a banana, along with a yougart dip. You have an option to eat by the pool. For breakfast, it is a must. The mornings are cool (relatively) and just pleasant to be outside.<br/><br/>The coffee shop is a typical cooffee shop. The breakfasts are normal fare, eggs, bacon, pancakes... The service was good but we thought the prices were a little high.<br/><br/>We never ate at the buffet, the deli nor the Mexican restaurant. Due to reviews, we also did not eat at the pizza place. Looking at the short lines when we went by, I would say most people did not eat there.<br/><br/>T.I. does have a nice pool. It is small for the size of the hotel. However, we were down poolside by 9am on a couple days and had no problems getting chairs. The pool area is kept clean and the service was good.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say we got what we paid for. You will not be blown away by anything at T.I nor will you be overly disappointed. We had an enjoyable stay. The help were all, well, helpful. Everything was in working condition. The facility could use a bit of a make over but, again, not anything that was a deal breaker. <br/><br/>The bottom line is would we stay there again? Probably not. Not because we did not enjoy ourselves but because we would like to try something different. If you are looking to keep your expenses down but want to be on the strip, T.I. is a good choice.	4	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

We had no issues and would highly recommend this property. But again, it is all about expectations. We had a great rate from a discount hotel site and even with the resort fee (which is rediculous but we know about it so we included it in our hotel budget) the price was right. You can't expect the world. But the check in for us was very fast (albeit this was at 8:30pm so not as busy as early afternoon). The room was updated and modern. The small-ish flatscreen TV worked great, as did the safe. Sure, maybe the casino itself is not as nice as others on the strip but it was fine too and the ventilation kept the smoke down unless someone was smoking right next to you. We only had the buffet lunch one day and it was pretty good, but probably only worth it with the 2-1 coupon. Drink service at the casino was excellent. The pool was also OK. Just go first thing in the morning if you want to relax. Don't bring the kids in the afternoon when it turns into a party crowd. The main thing is location. It is close enough to everything to be convenient, but outside the craziness of the south strip. There is a strip express and deuce bus stop just outside which was very convenient to both go to the south strip and downtown (we even used the strip express to get to the airport - transfer at south strip terminal to a 109 to save the $20 cab fare). It was nice having the mall next door too.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	4	-1	4

We booked the rooms through Priceline for $65 per night, but still had to pay the resort fee of $22.50 per night. For the resort fee you get in-room wi-fi and the use of the fitness center. <br/>Check-in was awful as I stood in line for 50 minutes. The room was fine but basic. Our a/c unit worked okay but it was pretty loud when trying to sleep; the smaller flat screen television was okay and came with minimal basic channels. The pool area was just average. There was a lot of debris in the pool from the surrounding palm trees. Do not plan to use this pool if you come with the intentions of swimming. This pool is shallow at 3.5 ft, and people just hang out and drink (which is fine by me) with very little swimming going on. The fitness center was good, and they provide fresh fruit, bottled water, and towels. Overall, we had a nice stay, but try and get discounted rooms. Even with the minor setbacks, I would stay here again.	3	-1	-1	-1	3	3	-1	3

I have to admit that I was very skeptical about booking this hotel. We normally stay at the MGM, but with the boxing fight being that weekend rooms were sold out or overpriced. We decided to give Treasure Island a try because of its great location in the center of the strip. <br/><br/>Upon arrival I was disappointed that the desk was not open for early check in until a certain time and that a line was already beginning to form. Besides that I was very impressed with the hotel once we checked in. The room was comfortable and very clean. I am very picky when it comes to hotels and Treasure Island exceeded my expectations. We were celebrating our anniversary and the hotel sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne which was a very nice gesture. Our room overlooked Pirates Cove and the strip and the noise wasn't a factor at all. I told my husband MGM will always be MGM, but we now have another solid option for future visits.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

Our family plus a few friends came down, and we didn't have any issues with TI. Yes, the Saturday check-in line was long (we got there around 1:00 and waited about 30 minutes) but what do you expect? It's Vegas! There was a guy in line with a 12 pack of cold Bud Light; seems he had the right idea. We also didn't get our room key until 3, but again, THIS IS WHAT TIME THE ROOMS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE READY. So no big deal. They held our luggage while we ate lunch and explored the Strip. <br/><br/>TI is a great location on the Strip. We walked everywhere except the Rio (to see Penn &amp; Teller), but it was a short 5 minute cab ride away. We didn't make it down to MGM, Mandalay Bay, New York, etc but probably would have walked it if we had more time. The people directing the cab traffic at TI deserve special praise as it was one of the most organized pickup/dropoff areas I saw. <br/><br/>We got 2 non smoking connecting rooms when we checked in, which is what we wanted. They were kept clean and the sheets and towels were changed daily. Housekeeping starts early though - I was sleeping alone at 8 am and was apparently walked in on by a maid because I'd forgotten to put the Privacy thing on the door (thank God I sleep fully clothed). She backed out of the room and ran into my family (who was coming back from Walgreens) and let them know she'd come back later. I never even woke up. We all got a good laugh about it.<br/><br/>The casino is okay. It's not the best or the worst on the Strip, but I'm not much of a gambler, so that was fine for me. The dealers are patient.<br/><br/>Didn't go to any shows at TI, so I can't review that.<br/><br/>I ended up spending most of my hotel drinking time downstairs at Gilleys. I don't like country music, but being from Georgia, the bar felt like home. I didn't have any rude servers (like several reviewers have said). In fact, the awesome day shift bartender remembered my brother's birthday and both mine and my mom's drink order the next day. He's very sarcastic, so perhaps that was interpreted by some people as rude; I however loved it. The bar isn't crowded at all in the daytime, which is a nice change from the rest of the Strip if you need to chill for an hour. At night, it's much more crowded and draws a very casually dressed group - no dress code here but there's a live country band most nights and plenty of line dancing. They have a mechanical bull that seems to be in constant rotation - both my brother and my dad rode it and loved it (and we loved watching them fall off!). You get a free bull ride on your birthday. I wasn't very impressed by the food, but it was edible and some things were better than others.<br/><br/>We tried Kahunaville, but it was pretty dead on Monday night. The bartenders do a few flair tricks, so that's neat. <br/><br/>The buffet was great; again, some things were better than others. The mashed potatoes were awesome. The pizza was not awesome. <br/><br/>I did spend an hour at the pool in the morning, and it is a small pool, but I was only out there because my group wanted to go. I don't get why you go to Vegas to hang out by a pool when you can do that anywhere else, but whatever. They seemed to enjoy it.<br/><br/>The rooms were very nice and spacious without a lot of frills. I would have liked a microwave/fridge combo, but that's not a deal breaker for me. If you absolutely need a microwave/fridge, book somewhere else. I was glad the room was so basic. It encouraged us to spend more time in Vegas doing exciting things as opposed to spending time in the room.<br/><br/>The Sirens show is kitschy, but definitely worth seeing. If you hear fireworks and loud booms from your hotel room the first night, it's the Sirens show (I thought I had really loud neighbors or something until I figured it out). It only lasts about 10 minutes and it's over early, though. Our non strip view room on the 11th floor was very quiet at night.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd stay there again. Great value for the price.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	4	-1	5

Booked the rooms through hotels.com. Did not get smoke free rooms but had one room upgraded to a suite for free. On the other hand, the suite was not much better than a room. Did not get strip view for one of the rooms as booked. Check in was quick and staff was nice and friendly. Pool was nice and not crowded in the morning but after lunch it was filled and partying people so it was impossible to use it then. Indoor resturant and bar was good and with friendly athmosphere. I will probably not stay here again, if you travel with kids and want to use a pool in Vegas do not stay at a casino hotel.	4	-1	-1	-1	3	4	-1	3

We decided it would be a perfect place to stay since we were only here for a couple days and just needed a suitable room for my boyfriend, 1 year old daughter, and me. The room was clean and didn't have any noise problems with neighbors at all. We booked the &quot;Strip View&quot; room through hotels.com and didn't have any problems checking in our anything. The view was magnificent and the price was great. I highly recommend Treasure Island if you are keeping in mind a budget friendly trip.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

Overall I found TI to be perfectly acceptable for a Strip Hotel. Decent room, as good as any in Vegas if a bit smaller than say a suite at the Venetian across the street. The staff was polite and helpful at check-in and at the Players Club. The casino and the hotel in general is a bit smaller than many of the others and it's pretty easy to navigate around and find what you need. They have limited dining options but the other hotels within walking distance provide plenty of alternatives. I will say that my dinner at Isla the Mexican restaurant in TI was really wonderful. Great service , great food and a fun atmosphere. <br/>The pool is really small and not much more than a watering hole in a concrete parking lot. I don't use it but if you are looking for pool action TI would be a bad choice. Same with the Spa which I did use. It is small and not the cleanest. I've been to much better at other nearby hotels.<br/>Bottom line- If you're looking for a base in a smaller hotel in the center of the action and you don't care about the pool or spa, TI isn't a bad deal.	5	-1	-1	-1	3	4	-1	4

Me and my wife had a good time by the pool (they have two - the smaller is a warm water pool), having some frozzen, enjoying the casino and having lunch in The Buffet at TI (this is one of the best deals in Las Vegas - very good meal for a good price). In front of the hotel there is a Walgreens store, which is pretty convenient. It is also close to a Mc Donalds restaurant, and to the beatiful Palazzo and The Venetian hotels. In general, this is a very good place with a good price. Before booking, request a membership over their website. There are some special offers that should be sent to your email. This clue applies for most hotels in Las Vegas.	4	-1	-1	-1	3	4	-1	4

It is walking distance to everything, although it is far to walk to the end of the strip from there. We had a great room with beautiful view, new and clean. Very comfortable. We checked in around noon so maybe that is why we had a nice room. I heard some others were not so lucky. The outdoor pool is very small in comparison to the hotel capacity, so we felt like sardines around the pool. In the pool on Thur-Sat there was a real party atmosphere, very packed with mostly young people. I was totally discussed when I noticed something very &quot;questionable&quot; floating on the surface. Disgusting. Also, they serve these cool drinks in veeeery large glasses- looks cool- the price not so cool $24!!!! We had a rental car and the parking is free in every hotel so it was well worth to keep the car for the extra few days. The Sirens show at the TI was nice- free, service was good and the restaurant in the hotel was excellent- we ordered an appetizer platter- yummy. To summarize, if you just want a good room in a nice hotel with great location, TI can be your choice. If you look forward to spending time in or around the pool, not so good.	4	-1	-1	-1	5	4	-1	5

I will start off with the front desk since that is where it all starts. I have read reviews from others about how bad the check in is and the long lines. I have stayed at this hotel four times now and have always had a great experience with check in. I have never waited longer than about 15 minutes to check in even when the line looks very long . Three of my trips to Treasure Isand have been comped. Thats right absulutely free. I am a slot machine player and Treasure Island is very good about rewarding their players. Not only do i recieve a free room for two nights but they give me food and beverage credits and free slot play . I have to do a little comparison with this hotel to the excalibur since I have stayed at both. Treasure island allows me to put a $100 a night cash deposit down in order to get my resort credits since I do not have a credit card . The excalibur would not allow me to do this so I could not get these resort credits that i was offerred and that was the only reason i stayed there for a night. The lobby to check in at Treasure Island is Beautiful. It is away from the casino unlike the excalibur so you are not standing in smoke while checking in which gives you a cleaner feel. The lobby over looks the pool area so as your checking in you see all the sunbathers relaxing and having a great time . Such a nice atmosphere. I have heard others complain about how they do not like the smell of this hotel. I disagree, I love the smell here and it is the scent of their products from the spa. This comp we just had was for a petite suite and we loved it. The suites are close to the elevators which I thought might be a problem with noise but we did not hear a thing. This seems to be a quiet hotel. In all the times we have stayed there we have never encountered a problem with noisy people in the halls and have never heard any noise from the rooms next to us. The TV is a flat screen but it is small . It dosnt matter to us since we are not there to watch tv. As I said in my first review of this hotel, the beds in this hotel are so comfy. The bedding and sheets are soft and the bed is perfect. We had a pull out couch but it was not very comfortable so my daughter slept with me. Also when pulling the bed out we noticed that it had not been vacuumed underneath in awhile and there was a dirty bandaid and other clutters under it. This is an older hotel so their are some small things that show its age like paint chips or scuffs on the walls but nothing major. We had a nice big whirlpool tub in the suite in one bathroom and a nice shower in the other bathroom. Our room was a pool view room but also had an awesome view of the srip. If you stay on a higher floor you use elevators that bypass all the other floors which makes thins so much quicker and organized. At the excalibur we litterally stood there for fifteen minutes for an elevator which does not happen here. Both my kids are in love with the buffet. They have excellent food. My kids love the bbq ribs and chicken and my daughter says they have the best mac n cheese ever. I am a huge fan of the pasta bar, its very good . We ate at the kahunaville restaurant for breakfast one day. At check in you recieve a coupon for 3 eggs, bacon or sausage , breakfast tators and bread for $7.99 and it is well worth it. They give you about four strips of bacon and the tators are very good . Its a very filling breakfast. They also have poolside dining which is nice. The service here was a little bit slacking and slow and not very friendly. I havnt eaten and gilleys which is a bbq restaurant or the cafe they have there. There is also a vietnemese restaurant but i do not care for that kind of food. I have never had the chance to use their spa but would love too. In the bathroom of the rooms you get shampoo, conditioner, and soaps that are from their spa and i love the scent which is the scent i smell when i walk in to their lobby. Compared to a lot of other resorts there is not a lot of shopping options at this hotel but only a few gift shops. The location of this hotel is great. There is a tram that takes you over to the mirage and the venetian , palazzo and wynn are across the street and it is also very close to the forum shops at ceasars palace and right across the street at fasion show mall. Weve seen the pirate show over and over. Its more of an adult show than for kids. If you like sleep i would suggest not getting a view of the show due to cannons going off every hour. We used the pool for the fist time and enjoyed it. It is a small pool, no water slides or anything to special. Its very relaxed and not full of hard bodied drunk 21 year olds like some of the other hotel pools. If is was a hard bodied 21 year old i migh enjoy that but im not so i dont. I also really liked the variety of music played at the pool. A little country ( im a country fan), some hip hop and rock n roll all mixed together. I really like treasure island. By far the best service and nicest front desk staff, good food, and pleasant atmosphere.	5	-1	-1	-1	4	5	-1	5

These were negatives, but expected.<br/>Our room was a &quot;deluxe&quot; one on the 18th level witth a good view out over the mountains and a sideways view along the Strip. It was a reasonable size with plenty of hanging and drawer space. The decor was in good order, however the woodwork in the bathroom looked a bit knocked about.<br/>We went to Wynn's buffet on our first evening - tremendous choice and excellent value.<br/>For breakfast we found Kahunavilla to give better choice, service and value than the other options in TI.<br/>The casino was small and low-key enough not to scare off novice gamblers.<br/>We'd definitely consider coming back here if we're ever in Las Vegas again.	4	-1	-1	-1	3	3	-1	3

We had a view of the strip as well as the Siren's Show. It was a truly awesome experience...but the icing on the cake was the BED!!! Lol. They were so comfortable that we found it hard to get ourselves up to do something.<br/>The Buffet was Delicious! Wide variety of food &amp; the desserts were wonderful. It was well worth the $23 per person weekend price. Cheaper Mon-Fri &amp; you get a buy 1 get 1 free coupon in your room for the weekdays. Also Kahunaville had a great breakfast for $8 (with coupon) &amp; My &quot;virgin&quot; Pina Coladas were Perfect! lol.<br/>The ONLY downside was they close the pool at 8pm on the dot...I mean actually start cleaning up 10 minutes before. It would've been nice to sit &amp; relax under the stars in the jacuzzi. I'm sure there was good reason However we still had a Great time. (There was an orange condom floating in the pool but people are people &amp; there is always one knucklehead in the bunch)<br/>Thanks Ti, we will definitely stay again.

On the first day, I witnessed a dealer comment on several players?moves by telling them they were &quot;stupid plays&quot;. I also caught a dealer trying to take my money after the house broke. I was playing alone at the table and the math was pretty simple (5+5+4+8). As the dealer was taking my money, I called her on it. The pit boss came over, checked the math, and refunded my money. When I complained to their security, they seemed uninterested in following-up. Stay away from this casino. There are much better options out there.	2	-1	-1	-1	3	1	-1	3

It was our third time to Las Vegas and we had never stayed in TI before. On our previous visits we weren?? located ideally on the strip. TI was perfect for getting to everywhere. The cost compared to other hotels was very good.<br/><br/>The hotel itself was clean and the service was very good. We arrived at around 11am which was obviously 4 hours prior to check in. A nice gentleman on reception allowed us to check in 2 rooms early. It was one of our friends 23rd birthday and they offered champagne for both rooms which would be brought to the room free of charge when requested.<br/><br/>The rooms were clean, modern and offered all amenities required. <br/><br/>The hotel itself has great bars including Gillys which was fun and chilled.<br/><br/>The pool area was lively. My friends and I got a cabana on the last day of our stay. It cost $220 but it was definitely worth it. There is no obligation to buy drinks and you get free soft drinks, TV, safe and comfortable sun lounges.<br/><br/>The check out was painless and I would definitely recommend TI to anyone thinking of going to Vegas.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

Myself and a group of friends stayed here and had no problems. Our check-in took approximately 20 minutes. The staff was friendly and efficent. It was a few group members birthdays and the hotel sent complimentary champagne to them. The room was a good size, clean, and had fresh linen. We stayed on one of the higher floors and had no problems with no noise or smoking on our non-smoking floor. The hotel has many places to eat. The Pho restaurant was good and not too overly priced. <br/><br/>Overall, a great bargain if you're looking to stay in a comfortable hotel and are trying to stay on a bugdet or save your money for gambling or shows. There are resort fees at this hotel, fyi.	4	-1	-1	-1	3	3	-1	3

Chose TI because of the location, price, and fun factor for the kids. We did not take them to see Sirens! <br/><br/>Rooms are smaller than newer Vegas hotels but are nice and we had a perfect view down the strip and of the pool from the 24th floor, though the 1 window was on the small side. Was surprised there was no fridge or minibar, which we've had at all other Vegas hotels we've stayed at. Beds are comfortable, lighting was good, bathroom was nice, and plenty of drawer/closet space for the 4 of us. Wifi is included in resort fee and worked great. <br/><br/>We generally travel to Vegas with friends for fine dining, spa, clubs, and relaxation and I'm not sure I'd choose TI for that kind of trip but I was very happy with it for this trip. They've done a nice job of keeping the facilities updated and the location is good (would have been better if the monorail to Mirage was working). <br/><br/>Only complaint was check-in. We were there at around 11am to check-in and waited in line for almost 45 minutes. Ridiculous.	4	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	4

It's next door to the Mirage and across the street from the Venician, and two doors from Ceasars Palace. I do suggest you print off your reservations if you make them online. Luckily I did, as I had reserved a room with the Strip View and paid extra for it, but when we tried to check in they said they didn't have me booked in a strip view room and asked if I had documentation of the reservation stating such. I said I sure do and brought it out to him. I think it surprised him I had it, so he ended up having to upgrade us to the top floor with a spectacular view of the strip! If you plan on going on bus tours the buses line up on Sirens Cove rd, so be sure to have the right rd to wait on. The restaurants in this hotel are pretty expensive. You do get a lot of food, but breakfast for 2 can easily be $40.00 w/ tip. There is a McDonald's just across the street down a little bit. The hotel will give you coupons to the Kahunaville Rest. but don't be fooled by them. Dinner is still outrageously priced and the service is horrible. Please don't bother going there. Check in was quick on a Saturday night, late, but check out on Thursday morning was horrible. They have 2 lines,one for check in and other for check out, but apparently people don't pay any attention and they were allowing guests to check in in the lines for check out which takes a lot longer. The Sirens Cove show on the pirate boats was pretty much a Brittany Spears show on crack. Lots of sex so please don't bring your little children. Not only is the content not appropriate, but the cannons firing and the heat of them could scare them as well. All in all we will learn the tricks of the trade as we take more visits there, but for right now, we would stay again at TI. Have a great trip!	4	-1	-1	-1	5	3	-1	5

We booked online and were not disappointed with a room on the 18th floor. On a previous trip to Las Vegas stale cigarette smoke was a problem at most casinos, but I can happily say this is not a problem at Treasure Island, not even on the casino floor! <br/>The rooms are a very good size and the beds are so comfortable and large, we booked a double Queen room. Bathroom large and plenty of nice toiletries and thick towels. This hotel also does a very good and varied breakfast, lunch and dinner buffet but also has a few other restaurants to choose from all quite good.<br/>Fantastic pool area with wet bars and plenty of poolside lounges to park yourself in either sunny or shady areas.<br/>Walking distance to everything, but even better you can take the free Tram to the Mirage and from there make your way down to the end of the strip using the free monorail between the Bellagio - Monte Carlo and the free tram from Excalibur to Mandalay hotels.<br/>Treasure Island offers it all.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

We checked in fine got 2 rooms next to each other and 2 free bottles of champaigne for my birthday. No doubt had we had been a group of hot girls we would have got upgraded to a better room but didnt plan on spending much time in the rooms so not really an issue. <br/><br/>Compared to other Vegas hotels TI is on the small side but if your staying here its blessing in disguise, not far to walk to your room and near impossible to get lost after a night on the drink. The rooms are probably not as big as other places but still spacious and clean and provide everything you need.<br/><br/>The pool area was good and from Thursday - Saturday was bouncing with a pool party atmospeare although weather if this had something to do with the EDC festival im not too sure. We got a cabana on our last day and found that it was great value for money something Id recommend if theres a group of 4 or more.<br/><br/>As for restaurants and bars in the hotel we only really tried Gilleys and Kahunaville. The latter was good for hangover food during the day as it provides the pool food as well. The service was abit on the slow side but it wasnt a major issue. We went in one night for a couple drinks and there was a live band on who dont even deserve to be playing at Butlins. I have no idea if they were a house band or performing for one night but was definatly not worthy of Vegas. Gilleys was a good change from the luxury bars around Vegas and had a sort of tourist feel about it. My big concern was it was a themed bar but it attracted all the cowboy stereotypes. Its like seeing a British themed pub full of British, why travel so far to go somewhere thats just like home. <br/><br/>TI isnt the most luxurious but then it certainly ranks higher than the Luxor and Excalibur and has better location than MGM and New York New York. If your doing Vegas on a budget then TI is the place to go.	4	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	4

This gets you wi-fi, a local newspaper (?), notary services(???), some buy one/get one drink coupons. <br/><br/>For our five night stay we were in three different rooms. The first room would have been perfect if the air conditioner worked. When we called about the problem at 6PM, the front desk told us that they could send up an engineer between 9-11PM. I'm not waiting for the cable guy! I'm on vacation and this was totally unacceptable, so they eventually moved us to a room down the hall that overlooked the pool and the strip. This seemed like a nice room. However, don't EVER get a room that overlooks the pool! The music starts at 8am and even on the 17th floor you can hear it all! <br/><br/>Finally, we had it with the room situation and went to the front desk and spoke to a manager. The manager looked at me like I was an idiot and reluctantly moved us to a 'petite suite'. In the room, there was mold in the shower grout, light fixtures were rusty and the carpet was dirty. We decided to just suck it up and deal with it. <br/><br/>Service is an entirely different issue at this hotel. We travel a lot and have never run into people in the service industry who could care less about the guests. While at the pool one day (if you can't beat 'em, join 'em), we ordered drinks from one of the pool waitresses, but I guess since we didn't order $25 frozen drinks she thought she could ignore us and never brought our drinks. <br/><br/>Other than the age issues with the hotel (old fixtures/mold/rust etc) the hotel was fairly clean. We would not recommend it for people who don't want a 24 hour party and look for something a little more classy.	2	-1	-1	-1	3	1	-1	2

We arrived around 7.30pm but it took 90 minutes to find our requested rooms and check in. There were soooo many people in the queue to check in but just not enough staff to handle the large crowd. We had requested two rooms (one for the parents and one for the three teenage children) and we were not able to have the adjoining room as we had requested. They were not even sure if they were going to be able to find a room with two doubles for the kids. In the end, after 90 minutes of waiting they were able to find us two rooms nearby but after such a long wait we were feeling rather deflated and it was after 9pm that we finally made it to our rooms. When we did get there our rooms were lovely and everything was beautiful. Beds extremely comfortable, rooms very clean. But the damage was done and we won't stay again. For those wanting to stay there I would recommend checking in at the earliest possible time. We were compensated by not having to pay the resort fee and the next day staff were very sorry for our bad experience.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	2	-1	5

Had to RUN (almost screaming) from Imperial Palace.......The rooms were renovated two years ago. Spacious standard room. Contemporary design. Wonderful food options. Our friend LOVED Canter's deli. Awesome location, shopping everywhere you turn, the Fashion Show Mall, The Forum Shops and The Miracle Mile - what more could a girl ask for???? The TI Sirens show right below us. Headed over to the Venetian this morning. I am in heaven. <br/><br/>Cons: the TV is smaller, maybe 24 inches.

Now I have read the bad reviews on here, and I completely disagree with them, and I am a tough critic (see my review on The Luxor). We arrived at 9.30am and checked in within 5 mins. Nobody seemed to mind that we were 4 hrs early! Our room was clean and spacious with a huge bathroom and an amazing view of The Strip. It was cleaned every day, even when we decided to sleep in until 2pm. We had friends staying at The Venetian and The Bellagio, paying more than double our rate, and our room at T.I was just as good as the Venetian and much, much more spacious than the Bellagio. We ate at Kahunaville, The Buffet and The Coffee Shop. My one complaint- do not eat at Kahunaville. Really depressing atmosphere at lunch, and the food was revolting. Apart from that we had an overall great experience! Would stay there again 100%.	5	-1	-1	-1	4	3	-1	5

While there are nice things about the hotel (two bathrooms in a one bedroom room, multiple on-site restaurants, etc.), by the end of the trip, I realized the cons outweighed the pros.<br/><br/>When I checked in, the computer system went down, so it took a while for the line of people to get checked in. While there's nothing they could do about the computer system going down, there was no sense of urgency in getting the system back up. Co-workers told me that it took a long time for them to get checked in, as well.<br/><br/>As with most hotels with a casino, you have to walk around the casino to get to the elevators to your room. There is no quick way around. I went back to my room at various times of day and always found a crowded, smoky, slow trip to get to the elevators.<br/><br/>The room itself was nice, except for the shower, which smelled mildewy and moldy, a smell that never dissipated, despite me leaving the shower door open and housekeeping coming through. It smelled up the whole bathroom and hall. I never felt like I was getting totally clean.<br/><br/>Room service could be quick (20 minutes for a sandwich on a Friday night) or very slow (an hour for a hamburger on a Monday night).<br/><br/>The location was nice, right across the street from a Walgreen's and a short walking distance from the Mirage and the Venetian.<br/><br/>The hotel wasn't horrible or even bad, just tacky, sometimes gross, and a bit inconvenient. If you're going to Las Vegas, I highly recommend the Rennaissance Marriott, which has no casino and is very clean and nice or would suggest paying the money to stay at one of the higher end hotels on the strip, like the Venetian.	3	-1	-1	-1	3	3	-1	4

The cost was $40.00, and the room was deplorable. Thefirst appearance of this place is inviting...until you enter your room! Holes in the walls, broken glass from non-functional light fixtures, dirty towels and bedding! The only thing that seemed to work properly was the AC unit. I suspect they maintain the air conditioning for the comfort of the RATS that must otherwise occupy the rooms when not being rented! My wife nearly puked by the odor once we opened the door to the room. someone had wiped poo p on the bathroom wall it was dried and left for the next person, which me &amp; the wife. the shower head was broke and sprayed on the mirror.

Our rooms were clean,comfortable and pretty quiet. The beds were extremely comfotable, so much so that i had to inquire as to what brand of mattress they use on their beds. {Sealy posturepedic pillowtop} The hotel/casino is laid out so you can easily find your way around everything without getting lost. The fitness room was okay, the pool isn't very large but we always found a lounger to lie on. The kahunaville restraunt and bar has entertaining bartenders who juggle your favorite bottles of spirits. The hotel staff were polite we didn't have any negitive experiences with any of them. The fashionmall is right accross the street as is a Walgreens. Overall l'd say the TI is large enough to have lots of fun. small enough not to get lost in, we would stay there again	3	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	5

I was an &quot;invited guest&quot; and our line was quite long with only one person checking us in! They did finally get another couple people to help but still stood in line for about 45 min. Wasnt really surprised at this from all the other reviews, plus I knew it would be bad on a Saturday holiday weekend. We received our 2 queen room as requested. Room itself is nice, a little outdated. I like the TI because of its smaller size. It is an easy casino to find your way around. We did eat at a few of the resturaunts on the property. Canters Deli(word of advice-split a sandwich, they are HUGE!), the Buffet(just for breakfast, twice-food very good-loved the omelets, Kahunaville(nice, fairly reasonable priced lunch with coupons received at check in) , Pizzeria Francescos(the most expensive pizza I have ever eaten! Was good, but $50 for for a large pizza and 2 beers-wow!), and of course Ben and Jerrys( Yum!). Enjoyed the Fashion Show mall, just across the street. For inexpensive shopping there is a nice Walgreens across the street at the Palazzo/Venetian..Watched the Sirens show, pretty cheesy and dont get too close to the ship, the fire that comes out at you is HOT!! All in all was a good stay. I think TI although it is starting to show its age, is a great value! I would stay again for sure!	4	-1	-1	-1	3	4	-1	3

It was worth the additional charge to have a larger room and two (2) bathrooms! The whirlpool tub was a treat-perfect for relaxing after a long day/night of hitting the strip. The bed was quite comfy. TI is toward the north end of the strip, but easy access to the monorail makes getting around easy. Check in for us was fairly quick, but there were long lines most of the day, as with many of the Vegas hotels we walked through. Of course you must walk through the casino to get to every restaurant and shop, which is again, standard for Vegas. We saw Mystere, a Cirque de Soleil show at the TI and loved it! Shopping not as great in TI as in other larger hotels, but it is easy to walk across the street to the Venetian shops. Coffee Shop had tasty breakfasts and the Italian Steakhouse was fair to good. One suggestion-request a room at the end of the hall away from the elevator lobby. People cannot seem to comprehend that they should use their &quot;inside voices&quot; at 3 am when in the hallways and no longer in the casinos.	4	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	3

It is manageable in size in terms of getting around quickly. The regular room and petite suite are great rooms. Valet parking is efficient, even at crowded times. Beds are great for sleeping and rooms are generally quiet. Desk service is timely. Casino offers variety. Walking distance to the shopping mall and across the street from the Venetian. Connected by tram to Mirage. We have stayed around at other hotels (Golden Nugget, Mirage, Bellagio, Paris, Caesar's, Palazzo, etc.) and we keep coming back to TI and after our last experience at the Golden Nugget, we have decided we just aren't going to try out other hotels in the future - it will be TI for us.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

We are easy going, like to have a good time, and aren't hard to please.<br/>Another couple went w/ my husband and I for a 5 day stay in June. We have stayed at Tropicana before and liked the location but wanted to try something different. We thought it was a good price and would go back again.<br/> Our flight was late so when we got there they only had smoking rooms left even though we booked non-smoking. We weren't happy about it BUT the very next morning after other guests checked out, they moved us to a non-smoking room.<br/> The rooms were nice, updated, clean, and nice veiws out the windows. Bathroom was large and clean as well. Their shampoo, soap, and lotion smelled great. Never heard any of our neighbors either.<br/> They give tons of coupons for 2-for-1's drinks, and coupons for meals there as well. We liked the food, it tasted good. It is a pretty casino with nice and fun dealers. If you want $5.00 Craps get there early in the morning, by 10:30 am it went up to $10.00.<br/> The pool was good, get there by 9:30/10:30 if you want a chair. The environment was fun but chill. I would say the majority of the people there we late 20's to mid 40's. Most were drinking and just listening to the music. Not a crazy pool party if that is what you are looking for.<br/> The only thing I didn't like was the location, but it wouldn't stop me from going back there. If location is the worst thing about it then I would say it isn't bad at all.	4	-1	-1	-1	5	4	-1	5

I got in at 8:30 pm and only had a small wait to check in. Asked for an upgrade and got a strip view double on the 24th floor. Amazing view and you could see the Mirage volcano erupt and the Bellagio fountains from the room. It was clean and didn't smell of smoke. There was a Rave in town that weekend so it was crowded, but where isn't Vegas crowded. Room rate was reasonable and service was great. If you're expecting a 5 star hotel, go across the street. If you're looking for a clean AND COOL room to basically sleep in, TI is it. <br/><br/>Only complaint I do have is the smoke in the Casino, but ever casino is like that. As well, food is very expensive at TI and no fridge. The Resort fee was expected and I had a good connection each night.	4	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	5

Parking was reasonably convenient and free. Check in was very fast for us (3:00 p.m. Wed.), as was checkout. Elevators seemed plentiful. Avoid any two for one coupons, especially to Kahunaville (it is $10.25 for one manhattan in a plastic cup). The room was okay. The television obviously came from the era when flat screens were first invented. We were awakened by hallway noise twice. The pool area was fine, nothing special. I wouldn't dream of spending money on a day bed or cabana or drink.<br/>The resort fee ($22.40 per day) is, to me, a poor decision. We bid through priceline (great rate) but had to pay the resort fee upon check in. The clerk apologized, and I could overhear other clerks basically apologizing for the mandatory resort fee (and trying to explain it). Why not just increase the price of the room if the fee is mandatory? Then offer discounts from there if needed. This would prevent the hotel from angering the guests and prevent clerks from having to explain and apologize for the fee, and would accomplish the same thing revenue-wise for the hotel. This is the reason I didn't give this hotel four circles.	3	-1	-1	-1	3	4	-1	2

After visiting NY/NY later in the week I would say we made the right choice to stay at TI because NY/NY was terrible. Anyway, we stayed for 4 nights and we had some good experiences and some not so good so here goes. <br/> The Good- We booked at a discounted online rate and received a clean comfortable room on the 27th floor with a fantastic view of the strip. The rooms were quiet and so were the hallways our entire stay. The casino at TI is not overwhelmingly large and confusing like some places and it has a nice atmosphere. After two days we pretty much had the layout figured out. The table games were the best part of TI by far. Friendliest dealers on the strip. Thanks to Vincente and his pit boss for their trivia questions and upbeat attitude that kept us entertained! We found everywhere else on the strip had rude dealers that could barely speak english. This was especially true at the Mgm owned properties. The pool area was not too big but it wasn't filled with all 20 something 'look at me&quot; types either so it was family friendly for the most part. There is a Gilleys bar and restaurant here and we had a good time watching people get thrown off the mechanical bull. The location of TI is also great and they have a free tram that connects to the Mirage which was never too crowded during our stay, and it is also right next to Fashion Show Mall if you want to do some shopping.<br/> The Bad- TI charges an outrageous resort fee of 20 dollars per night which is a really nasty Vegas trend the last couple of years. Only the Harrahs properties are not charging this fee on the strip in case this matters to you. The bell service was the slowest I have ever personally experienced, but to be fair it was Friday during checkout times. You will not find any affordable dining choices here at all. Isla Mexican restaurant is awful and overpriced, we had 5 different dishes and they all tasted bad! Even the Deli was way overpriced and very unorganized. The cashier was literally taking over 5- 10 minutes per simple order. Two of us had to wait 20 minutes for a mediocre sandwich and hotdog for 20 bucks. The steakhouse was not open during our stay for some reason. There was one place that served up really good food and really good service and that was the Coffee Shop. But 85 bucks not including the tip for 4 people for breakfast? We had the buffet for breakfast also but it was terrible. For that price I would think they at least knew how to prepare eggs. I still dont know how they got those eggs to that watery gritty texture, ewwwwww! <br/> There is no perfect strip hotel by the way. Basically if you want a good location with a clean quiet room and still get the Vegas experience with some good table games and dont mind high priced meals and resort fees then TI is the place for you.	2	-1	-1	-1	5	2	-1	5

Not the middle or an exceptionally convenient location although it's a nice walk down towards Bellagio and Planet Hollywood and the like in the cooler evenings. We liked being right next to the fashion center mall and the fabulous Mexican restaurant (El Segundo Sol - eat the guacamole!) at the mall. <br/><br/>TI rooms were nice enough, although walking through the casino to get to the hotel elevators was an experience in smoke- smokers everywhere and very uncomfortable if you're not used to second hand smoke. I know all the hotels in Vegas allow smoking but they need to work on enhancing their air purifying systems to accommodate all that smoke. <br/><br/>We ate at the coffee shop, the Pho restaurant (awesome food!), the Mexican restaurant, the Siren's Bar (best place to watch the Sirens of TI show) and the buffet. Aside from breakfast, the service in the coffee shop and the pho restaurant was so slow. I mean, slow enough you aren't even hungry when your food finally arrives. The buffet was a pleasant surprise - not just an overwhelming glut of mediocre food - actually good stuff and not so much of it. <br/><br/>The pool has the usual issues of pools in Las Vegas. Too small. Too crowded and layers and layers of chairs just lined up. They advertise it as a &quot;pool party&quot; - luckily it's just too hot to really want to stay out by the pool. Instead, go to the spa. The spa was awesome. Resort prices but a nice way to relax and rest up in the relaxing areas with a magazine, a nap, some juice and AC.	3	-1	-1	-1	3	3	-1	4

Unfortunately, I believed and trusted the ad w/o calling Treasue Island ahead of time. When we arrived, the staff was rude and the female manager was exceptionally rude.

Only when we got to the hotel and checked in did we find out about the &quot;resort fee&quot; which raised that great rate by over 30%. Lots of Vegas hotels are doing these fees - they do vary from 9 bucks and up but alot of the Vegas hotels Don't charge it. Look online - there are lists. The &quot;resort fee&quot; covers for the T.I. anyway since it varies, Wifi, some coupons &amp; a free usa today everyday if you go to the front desk to get it.<br/> Pros of the hotel: Great pool, even has a large jacuzzi. We found lounge chairs, after a bit of searching for 2 together. Sheets and comforter were so comfy. We had a flat screen tv in our room, not sure if it's standard. Staff is nice and accomadating. Good location next to Mirage.<br/> Cons: Beside resort fee, no coffee maker in room and the Cafe on the main floor doesn't do tea/coffee to go but there is or will be a Starbucks soon.Bathroom towels were kind of crapy, quality wise. LONG wait at check in. SIren's show is pretty cheesy but the guys will like it. <br/> Just a warning, we needed a cork screw, they wanted to charge us 5 bucks to bring it up.	4	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	5

They just have (well atleast my room) only three lamps. And as spacious as the rooms it's not the best lighting. The second thing is, is that the maid service comes super early which stinks because half the people in Vegas don't wake up till about 11 and if you miss that crack of dawn knock on the door maid service your screwed till he next day.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	-1

Room was beautiful and clean (strip view) - loved the buffet if you have a sweet tooth, you will love the desserts and the homemade donunts!! The pool was just right.<br/><br/>Only con was the check in/check out process. Checking in was a good 45 minute wait at 12 pm - not enough staff at the front desk. Our check in hostess was so sweet. Wish I could remember her name. I told her that my husband &amp; I were celebrating our 1st wedding anniversary, and she immediately put in for a bottle of champange for us. <br/><br/>Checking out was worse - allow extra time for that as we were not able to do &quot;express check-out&quot; from out TV's in the room. Too bad we were only staying for 3 nights. Wish it could have been a longer trip. Will stay there again!	4	-1	-1	-1	5	4	-1	4

You do have to walk for a bit to get to the other casinos. <br/><br/>The casino here was good very lively although I'm not to keen on the fact people are allowed to smoke in casinos in Vegas. Service was ok, although I had to show my id even if I wanted water which I though was odd. <br/><br/>A good place although I would probably stay more central when I go back.	4	4	-1	5	4	4	-1	-1

Upon reaching a clerk, it was explained that housekeeping &quot;fell behind&quot; and that I could check-in but the room wasn't ready, and that I could come back in about an hour and see if it was ready. The clerk was pleasant, and seemed a bit uncomfortable that he had to deliver the news. Wasn't his fault, but I did explain that I was on east coast time, I was tired and it was ridiculous. He didn't disagree. Manager gave me a coffee shop comp for the hassle. Rest of my stay was fine. Room was clean, but very very obvious it was a rush cleaning job....no facecloths in the bathroom, no note paper or pen by the phone. Bed was comfortable, coffee shop and buffet were both fine. I just don't think there is any excuse for not having rooms ready to go 8 hours after check-in time....	4	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	5

When we arrived at 11:30pm, they didn't have our room ready, so they told us to return in a couple of hours. We took a walk down the strip and came back at around 2am. When we got to the desk they gave us a room key. We went to the room on the 5th floor (at the very end of the hall) and glanced out the window to see a parking lot and some back streets. Not a view of the strip which we had paid extra for. Also, there were yellow stains on a couple of pillows. No coffee maker either. We placed a call to the desk and explained that after waiting that long for a room to become available, we were not pleased with what we were given. The staff were not very helpful or friendly. The manager said there was nothing he could do and denied that we had paid for a deluxe room even though it was clearly written on my itinerary. I asked if I could leave a few days early and he told me that wasn't possible. So I was stuck there for an entire week. The next morning, we talked to the front desk and demanded the deluxe room we had paid for. They agreed to let us switch rooms and we moved up to the 35th floor. The view was great. However, I soon noticed that this room had its own flaws. The sink did not drain, the toilet backed up every evening, the radio didn't work, the TV only worked half the time, there was no refrigerator as advertised, no coffee maker, more stained sheets. Also, be prepared to pay extra for anything and everything that is normally complimentary with a hotel. $22 resort fee for using the phone, wireless internet, etc. They don't even inform you that their wifi is free. When you try to use it, it asks you to pay $7.99 for one hour or $21.99 for 24 hours. After doing some research, I learned that you will not be billed for it if you fill out the sign-in page and agree to pay the fee. But keep in mind that every hour/24 hours (whichever you selected), you will have to repeat this process. In the casino, there is a Starbucks which offers a &quot;free refill&quot; on coffee. I went back once to get my refill, and they tried to tell me that my cup was not from there even though I picked it up that morning. The barista asked, &quot;Are you sure?&quot;. Also, in the casino you will not be served free cocktails unless the waitress sees that you are gambling at least $20 or something like that. The atmosphere of the casino is not very welcoming, either. I wish I had chosen another. The pool has ridiculous hours (closes at 4pm) and has an MC on duty all afternoon who plays the same songs every day, over and over. You can hear him from your room whether the curtains are closed or not. Traffic noice is also very loud all the time in both the 5th floor and the 35th floor rooms I stayed in. When you finally are set free and able to check out, you'll have to wait in a line for 20-30 minutes to do so. The only upside of this whole experience was the excellent maid service. However, I did not feel like a guest at all. I'll do some more research next time.	2	-1	-1	-1	2	1	-1	3

The rooms were very nice and clean. Unlike most hotels where you don't dare touch the bedspread we wanted to take these home with us. We ate 4 times at the coffee shop...excellent food and huge portions! We could have shared every meal and been satisfied. They had excellent service too! We also ate at the buffet to use our by one get one free lunch coupon, we were not impressed at all. I had drinks with some local friends at Kaluahville, (sp?) had a great bartender show, which was very entertaining. I didn't really understand the resort fee at all, seemed awful expensive at $22 a day for not much in return. We also had a bad experience when my mom lost her phone, the front desk staff were very rude and not helpful at all, the lady at the bell desk and security on the other hand were very nice. Bottom line as long as you don't lose anything it should be a great stay!	4	-1	-1	-1	5	3	-1	5

There was a rocky start to our stay at TI. After waiting three hours for our two adjoining rooms to be ready we arrived to find all kinds of housecleaning problems... fresh bloody seman stain on the duvet cover, splattered who knows what on the mirrors and t.v., dust everywhere, smeared tables, dirty linens, more funny looking fluids on the chair and even what looked like a fresh spilled soda stain in the bathroom. We were walking around feeling quite grossed out and wondering if anything was clean. Anthony the Manager of housekeeping came in to inspect. He was embarrassed and immediately had everything cleaned and promised to compensate us and have the hotel manager call us but after five nights we never received a call and when we checked out there was nothing noted, thanks to Betsy she took care of contacting the hotel manager and getting us the compensation for our first night's stay which made us feel so much better about the whole experience. I only wish Anthony had followed up on this as promised and not made me have to spend the time at checkout trying to get it resolved. The rest of the days were great! We enjoyed our strip view, the fun dj and dancing at the pool, the craps tables and the great accessability to other casino's. Having Walgreens across the street was convenient for picking up water and other necessities. <br/>The biggest complaint I have is how smoky the casino is. They should work on their ventilation system or preferably only allow smoking in designated sections or not at all! Having it in in all the common areas made it impossible to get outside without smelling like smoke. For this reason we spent most of our time in the newer, better ventilated casinos. <br/>The food at Kahunaville was terrible and very expensive. The coffee shop was expensive but their breakfast was good. <br/>Thanks to Betsy I will stay at Treasure Island again in August and keep my fingers crossed that my room is clean!	5	-1	-1	-1	2	3	-1	5

Since there were 3 of us we needed 2 beds in the room. I even called a few days before to make sure we had that since the online reservation said king. I was assured we had 2 queens. Upon arrival they say I have a king ready and had to call around to see if there was a double queen rm available. I'm guessing they either made the room up quick or just gave us one someone else left since the beds looked like someone had been resting on them and there was a stain on one of the comforters! There was also no washcloths or bathmat in the bathroom.<br/> The hotel and lobby were beautiful except I can't believe they allow smoking in all the public places....all over Vegas ! The Sirens show was also a dissappointment. I expected sword fights between 2 pirate ships...not a ship of scantily clothed female pirates that had been out at sea &quot;a little too long&quot; enticing the male pirates to come over and have sex ! Not a very family friendly show as far as I'm concerned !!<br/> Never got to enjoy the pool...for some odd reason it closes at 7 PM !!	4	-1	-1	-1	2	3	-1	4

We only waited 5 minutes to check in on a Saturday afternoon at 5:00. The desk clerk we had was unpleasant, and our booking was a mess. So we got to our Tower Suite, and it was a disgusting smoking suite which we could not possibly stay in. We called the front desk and asked to be moved and of course they had no more suites. What a surprise. The moved us to a smaller Petite Suite which was actually much nicer than the Tower Suite. We had a king bed, a desk, a table and chairs, a couch and coffee table and two bathrooms. The bathrooms where huge, and having two was awesome! We had a crappy view of the roof of another part of the hotel which had huge fans on it that rattled all night. That was no fun. The housekeeping was very good, and the beds are amazingly comfortable. The casino is very nice, the restaurants very good, and the location on the strip is excellent as well. When we booked on line months before, the promo said we would be receiving a two for one buffet as well. This was not the case. Once there they told us we would really be getting a two for one lunch (lunch only, no brunch or supper) at a restaurant we did not want to eat at. Oh well! This was the second time we stayed at Treasure Island and both times we have had hassles and arguements to get them to understand what we had booked and what they were giving us were two different things. I doubt we would ever stay again. There are just too many hotels on the strip that will provide exceptional service to keep our business. And yes there is a resort fee, and there are many hotels on the strip that do not charge a resort fee. Hopefully this practice of resort fees will soon disappear and they will advertise the real price per night instead of advertising low prices and then surprising you will extra fees to make up for it.	3	-1	-1	-1	4	3	-1	4

Nor did we use the pool as we wanted to explore LV.<br/>Saw a show - Cirque du Soleil - in the Hotel, getting 2 for 1 price for tickets. The show was excellent and highly recommended.<br/>Overall, the Hotel was good enough, but the main casino area was a bit dark and un-inviting.

All in all, our experience was just okay . Our first night on the front end of our trip the hotel was completely booked and upgraded us to the suite level. That room was beauiful! The floor was quiet and the room was huge and nicely appointed. It had two outrageous bathrooms and it was impeccably clean. The second time we stayed here we had a basic king bed room and it was just okay. Below average, to be honest. There were stains on the ceiling and the rug in addition to the carpet not vaccumed well at all. The bathroom looked like it was cleaned quickly and there were random hairs left, ect. There was a collection of dust and tags, and papers behind the mattress against the wall under the headboard which was gross and telling of housekeeping not doing their job properly. The staff &amp; front desk underwhelmed us on all three occasions and were unfriendly. I would not stay here again on our travels to Vegas in the future.	3	-1	-1	-1	2	2	-1	3

The rooms are remodeled, nicely decorated, and the beds are so comfortable. Room service is always good, and the gambling is fun. Having Cantor's Deli is very convenient, and you can always find a chair WITH SHADE (!) at the pool. The location of TI meets my requirement of center strip, so that we're close to everything. We still cab it a lot, but things are convenient.<br/><br/>This round, we did have some issues with checking in (we were given a fabulous upgrade and the desk clerk got us adjoining rooms) - so we had to wait for the rooms to be cleaned. Even after waiting a few hours past check-in time, our rooms were not clean. We had to call management to get the rooms cleaned again. They were responsive, and added a refrigerator to one of the rooms for our use, with no charge, and took the first night off our bill. The only complaint is that the manager did not follow up as he promised (reflected in my friend's review below), but I will definitely stay here again.	5	-1	-1	-1	4	5	-1	5

Stayed June 25-Thurs, June 28, 2011. On Tuesday at 12:46AM, I wake up to someone opening my door. Glad the latch was on! At 12:53 AM, after confirming what happened by seeing the latch still sticking straight out, I call down to the front desk and say &quot;someone just tried to come into my room&quot;. The guy says he showed d me as checked out (after 1 day?), but knows I am staying until Thursday, sorry for the inconvenience. It takes me so long to get back to sleep that I miss my first class at my conference.<br/>I call back during the day and explain to a woman (supposedly the manager) what happened. She apologizes and asks if there is anything she can do, like give me a later check out. I say that will not work for me because my plane leaves early, but I would like to have a discount on the show they are having. She said they don't have a relationship to the show, but would find out. She leaves me a message and says I can get a ticket for $50 for a summer special. I go to the box office; they know nothing about a $50 ticket; you would have to buy 2 for $100 and those seats are sold out; I can have regualr price.

We had reserved two strip view rooms and requested connecting rooms for a bi-coastal family reunion in celebration of our sister's recovery from cancer. My sister made two phone calls prior to our check-in and was assured that although there was no guarantee, the probability of the request being granted was high. We received a COMPLETELY different story upon check-in. We arrived at the hotel at the stated check-in time and were told the request could not be granted. Needless to say, we were very disappointed. The desk person asked if we would like to speak to a manager, which we did. He made NO attempt at accommodating our request. He stated that he could give us two connecting, non-strip view rooms but we would still have to pay the strip-view rate since &quot;it was our choice to downgrade&quot;. We let him know that was unacceptable. We ended up staying on the same floor, but my sister was emotionally distraught because the family interaction she had visualized for so long was not a possibility.<br/><br/>The line for check-out reminded us of the lines at Disneyland. When we reviewed the room charges we found extra charges on one of the rooms. They were removed when the error was brought to the attention of the desk person. <br/><br/> Although the accommodations were acceptable, the poor customer service was not. We are regular Las Vegas visitors, but we have spent our LAST dollar at TI!	3	-1	-1	-1	4	1	-1	5

Took the Bell Transportation shuttle from the airport (excellent) which dropped us off right at the hotel walkway. Expecting a hugeline as other have mentioned for check in, we were pleasantly surprised to only wait about 10 minutes from arrival to check in. This was in the middle of the afternoon when we arrived and on a Tuesday. When we left on Saturday, the line was huge to check in - I'm guessing a 45 minute wait. Because we were celebrating 2 birthdays, they offered us a free bottle of champagne. The room we got was on the 29th floor above sirens cove. High enough for a great view and far enough away to not hear anything besides the fireworks from the show. The beds were the most comfortable I've ever had - Want one for my home! <br/>The Sirens show is overrated and screechy. We liked the old show much better. Also don't recommend eating at the hotel as most of the restaurants are very expensive and not great food. However there is one exception and that was for Canter's Deli - Huge portions, reasonable prices but slow service. I highly recommend the chicken noodle soup with a half sandwich of your choice. Yummy! <br/>Another suggestion is to use the public transportation busses instead of taxis or shuttles / monorails. $7.00 for a 24 hour pass and the busses run all along the strip to Fremont Street with may stops along the way. Easy access, regular stops and reasonable price! Gambling on Fremont Street was great and much cheaper than along the strip as are the restaurants. Fun place to spend an evening with all the glitter and lights, impersonators at every corner and free shows.<br/>We saw three shows - Lion King (Fabulous!) - Brought us to tears; Myst?re by Cirque du Soleil at Treasure Island (Amazing!!) and a comedy/illusionist show by Nathan Burton (Great!) - Pay for the upgraded seats ($15 is well worth it).<br/>Only downsides of the hotel are the pool - Way too crowded with lots of kids and not enough shade; No fridges or even a coffee maker in the room - We went across the street to Walgreens and bought a cheap styrofoam ice chest which we filled with ice and bottled drinks (water and ice teas) to keep in the room; and the restaurant prices.<br/>Other than that the trip was great and I would definitely go back and stay at Treasure Island!	4	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	5

We have stayed about 8 times n Vegas and each time we lke to stay at a different hotel.I completely understand how timing in a hotel can effect your check in, what is not understandable is how it was handled. First, we arrived at 11:30 at the hotel, We gave the bell man our bags and was told that we could check in at 1:00. We came back at 12:45 wanted to get there early expecting a line from reading past reviews. I was not dissappointed. We waited in line for at least an hour as we finally approached the desk I overheard the staff at the desk telling people to come back and pick up the keys. We were told when we got to the desk, by this time it was about 2:15, that our room would not be ready until 3:00 and to sign everything now and come back at 3 and pick up our key. This resulted in another hour long line. By this time all the people we stood with in the first line were back in the line to pick up keys, In addition there were new people checking in. There was even a huge line for the invited guests by the hotel. It was totally disorganized. People were cutting in line and the desk never once apoligized. They did call security when people were getting frustrated and making comments. When we finally got up to the counter we were told our room was still not ready and was told just because you were told to come back at 3 it does not mean our room would be ready then and again no apoligy. By the way this was told to us by an assistant manager.We settled for a room on another floor just to avoid the whole line experience again. When we arrived in our room, By now it is 4:30, we did not have a bed spread. As far as the rest of the week, Our cabana and our cabana waitress was awesome. The champaign we ordered on saturday was finally picked up on Tuesday. Our food we brought back to the room and ate was not taken away the next day even when we placed it by the garbage. We had a 50 dollar cabana credit that was not given on the bill. and there was a 22 a day resort fee. With as many choices there are to stay in Vegas, the customer serviceat this hotel needs a complete overhall to be competitive. The hotel is in a great location and has alot of of potential. I hope this reaches someone in charge there as the customer service there is a huge problem.	3	-1	-1	-1	3	1	-1	4

The hotel itself was okay. My room was nicely decorated and as clean as most hotel rooms I've stayed in. It certainly wasn't a luxury hotel, but for the price I paid I didn't expect that. My only complaint was that I had to wait 15 minutes to get my luggage out of storage (I was originally told it would take 3-4) and missed my shuttle to the airport.<br/><br/>If you want a hotel with a large and luxurious pool, this isn't for you.	5	-1	-1	-1	4	3	-1	4

The room layout is such that the furniture hardly fits in and room 28038 was dirty. I didn't want to walk on the floor without slippers and the deep spa was not clean and had hair in it..the bathroom floors looked like they needed a mop.<br/>All I ask is a clean room and a comfortable bed so I am not hard to please. The room had no in room dining menu in it and despite requesting a rollaway bed 9 months prior and confirming this via telephone many months ago, we had to wait hours and chase the said rollaway bed.<br/>We had no end of trouble trying to connect to the wifi internet, in the end they had to send 2 blokes into the room to remove the plasma and reset the wifi connection-all highly inconvenient late at night when 2 of us in the room were trying to sleep!<br/>The next morning, after confirming online that this room was in fact 100 feet smaller than the tower suite &amp; also not wanting to endure another night in an unclean room, we requested to be moved to a Tower Suite. What a difference! Room 26011 was huge and sunny, very clean and most comfortable. My faith in TI was somewhat restored, however there wasn't even an apology or anything for the 1st night's inconvenience.<br/>There are much newer hotels in Vegas, The Cosmopolitan, Palazzo (directly opposite TI) and Encore just to name a few.<br/>I wouldn't stay here again, although it is a good deal, I would rather pay more and have a truly exceptional stay.	3	-1	-1	-1	2	2	-1	3

This was our second time back and we enjoyed it just the same. We arrived late on the Sunday night due to our flight being delayed 2 hours. Check in wait time was only 10 minutes or so, but even though we reserved a king, there was only 2 queen available so late at night (8:30 p.m.) We were told we could come back down to the front desk the next day and change rooms to a king. That's exactly what we did and we were able to get a fabulous King room with a perfect strip view up on the 32nd floor. The room was clean and upgraded...just as nice as the last time we stayed. There was no noise from the hallway or the adjoining rooms, which is great for me because I'm a light sleeper. <br/><br/>The only downfall of this hotel is the available restaurants. Again, having no quick bites sends me to another hotel to get something cheap and quick. The Venetian has the best food court and lucky for us it's right across from TI. Also, the Fashion Mall is right across the other walk way and also has a huge food court. Walgreens is also right across the street which helps in buying small things for the room, munchies and water and beer ;o)<br/><br/>All in all, a great hotel, great service and a great price. You really can't beat the location either. <br/><br/>Best tip I can give you.....have a little fun at Kahunaville. It really is the best bar and the best flair bartenders. The free shots and show they put on is the best part. My husband and I were there every night!	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

We arrived late in the evening ready to check in to our room and get some rest. However, despite calling to confirm our reservation the day before, our room (along with literally a hundred other people waiting to check in), had apparently been given away. After waiting in line for hours, with little care or concern from the staff, we were finally shipped to another hotel and got to bed at 5am. Upon heading back to TI the next day, we were again greeted with very little concern for the trouble they had put us through...they offered us $50 off of the room at TI for the night before...THAT WE WERENT' ABLE TO STAY IN! Beyond that fiasco, our room didn't appear to have been cleaned very well and the casino dealers were the unfriendliest we encountered on the strip. The room rates were good, but the overall experience was terrible and was not worth the money we saved. I will definitely NOT be coming back!	3	-1	-1	-1	2	1	-1	3

But the price was great compared to the others and we were seeing shows on that side of the strip so I decided to try it out. We stayed in a Tower Suite which I loved mainly because I got to have my own bathroom. It was huge and had a big deep jet tub. The other bathroom was a bit smaller but still decent sized and had a big shower. The room was big, nice and clean and the bed was comfy. Anything I needed they made sure I had quickly. Check in was not too bad. Short to no taxi line. The smaller size just made it easier to get around and I had the layout figured out quickly. No 10 mile walk to anything. Casino was a nice size and just the right amount of people that it is enjoyable. Atomosphere was upbeat. There was a free tram that takes you right to Mirage, a bridge to the Fashion Mall and a bridge to the Venetian/Palazzo where there is a 24 hr Walgreens. The staff was very nice. I honestly have no complaints other then the dreaded resort fee If we need to be at that end of the strip again we will definitely be staying there.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

Traveled with 6 couples and enjoyed the pool, casino, nearby attractions, and the amenities of the rooms. Requested a higher floor room with a view of the pool, which also gives an awesome view of the strip. Food prices at the steakhouse were quite high, but hey, it's Vegas. We walked across the street to McDonald's and Denny's for breakfast for a cheaper start to the day.	4	-1	-1	-1	5	4	-1	5

For my family $20 is a very expensive newspaper. The last time I came, I complained to the lady at check-in. She said to express my displeasure on the TI website. So I did but did not receive so much as a reply. The bed is too soft and I requested a board to be placed under the mattress- it was brought up very promptly. The problem is check-in. We arrived around 9am and were told check-in was 1pm. Luckily the bellman mentioned that I could try around 11am. At 10:30 I asked the girl in the check-out line and she grudgingly mention 11am also. So mysteriously at 11am all these guest appeared and started to check-in. Can you imagine if you wandered around until 1pm- 4 long hours of walking around- and came back to find a check-in line a mile long, you would be a little annoyed. The pool is very small for so many guests. We found it best to go early- 9 or 10am- you only have the children to contend with as the loud and rowdy 20-somethings don't arrive until the afternoon.	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1

My most recent stay was August 4th-7th 2010. we got upgraded to a nice suite with 2 seperate bathrooms, one with a shower and the other with a whirlpool tub. Both bathrooms had a toilet and a vanity mirror and sink. very useful since it was 2 guys and 3 girls. Gave the girls plenty of room to get ready. They also gave us a complementary bottle of champagne delivered to the room shortly after we arrived. We did use room service which was pretty quick. Our room had a great view facing south on the strip...the time before that when I stayed, I had a north facing strip view. The south was much better and had more to see if you like views. The bed was very comfortable and we also had a pullout couch which wasn't too bad as far as pullout couches go. TI probably has one of the better Casinos IMO in vegas. I like the layout of it and it's not smokey at all (which a lot of the newer casinos are not). All in all, the only complaint I have about this property is the resort fees that they charge (around $15 a day if I'm not mistaken).	4	-1	-1	-1	5	4	-1	5

I went with a friend who wanted to stay here. The check in process took about 1 hour and the express check out didn't work, so we had another line. Getting to the lobby from the parking garage is confusing since the signs posted aren't very clear. The room was nice and the view was great, but that was an extra charge. The bed was the one thing that stood out, it was like sleeping on a cloud, even though one sheet had a large whole in it. When I went to get a drink, I found both glasses were dirty. Our trip was to see Jersey Boys, which was excellent again, so the location was great since it is just across the street from the Palazzo. If you want service, look for another hotel. If you want a great bed and not much more, this is the place for you. I won't go back.	2	-1	-1	-1	2	2	-1	5

Rooms are very nice, newly refurnished, spacious and clean. Main areas - lobby, halls, restaurants - are very fussy and noisy as the most cassino hotels in Vegas. We recommed to eat out. There is a nice pool area but the water was very dirty! Pool size is too small comparing the size of the hotel, thats why it was always crowded. On Fridays and Saturdays there are pool parties with Dj when the pool is even more crowded with drunk ppl and water more filthy. <br/>Hotel provides the shows of the Cirque du Solei in its own theatre.	4	-1	-1	-1	5	3	-1	5

Kind of cheesy, but don't let it fool you. This is a great hotel. <br/><br/>The staff is friendly, the pool is very nice. The beds are GREAT! The rooms are pretty spacious. The suites are like small condos; 2 rooms, 2 bathrooms, fridge and sink. <br/><br/>I would recommend staying here if you have children. It's seems kid friendly and they have the pirate show at night in front of the hotel...you can't miss the pirate ship in the front. <br/><br/>This is also a great location; across from the Venetian Hotel...almost smack dab in the middle of all the action.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

This time I am passing through on a business trip. I have a flight out of Las Vegas early in the morning so I decided I would rather fork out the money to have a good night sleep than leave my house super early in the morning and drive the 2 hours from my home to Las Vegas. Long story short, this review is only in regards to the room and checking in. Upon arriving on Sunday at 3:40pm I spent a good 20 minutes trying to find a parking space. I was surprised that there were so many people staying on an uneventful Sunday. After parking, I walked into the Casino and eventually found my way to the lobby to only be shocked by the crazy long line to check in (I could see this happening on a Friday but on a non-holiday Sunday?). After approximately 50 minutes I finally made my way to the counter. The gentleman working the counter was very professional and friendly which made up for the long wait IMO. I made my way up to my room which was a strip view room on the 22nd floor over looking the pirate ship. Upon first entering the room I thought &quot;Hey, this is not so bad&quot;. I then started to unwind and relax. I started to notice little things one after another which really built up into me feeling disgusted with the room. There are blood stains and other unidentifiable stains on the sheets, the bed wasn't made (the blanket was just thrown on top of the messy untucked sheets underneth), a couple of glasses have food stuck to them, the is a large amount of dust all over all surfaces, the carpet has not been vacuumed, trash on the sofa, and more. If I wanted an unkept room I would have booked a room at a motel on the north side just past the Stratosphere. I'm in my room writing this and right now I just want to get my night of sleep and get out of here. Oh, and the resort fee of $22 plus tax is just astronomical! The MGM Grande is the only hotel of their properties I have stayed at that I have been satisfied with every stay. It's sad that the room keeping is such a black eye on this hotel. If it were not for the uncleanliness I would have rated 4 stars.	3	-1	-1	-1	1	3	-1	3

We had a group of people stay at TI in 7 rooms. We spent thousands at the hotel pool, the restaurants, the bars, gambling, etc but when the hotel provided one of the people in our party with human feces on his supposedly clean bathroom towel, the best they could do for us was compensate us for 1 day of the resort fee and a credit for minimal room service, which was not even enough for the cheapest food item on the menu. <br/><br/>It's a joke the spend so much money at the hotel and not get the bare minimum of what you'd expect out of a hotel. I'd rather have rat feces on a towel instead of human feces. Do you know what kind of diseases can be passed with human feces? If the bathroom towel is not clean, doesn't it make you wonder what else in their hotel is not clean either? The staff were unwilling to work with us and still feel like we were fairly compensated for the incident- all 25 of us on the trip beg to differ. <br/><br/>Avoid this hotel at all cost. There are a LOT of other hotels on the strip that you should stay at before considering this one.	1	-1	-1	-1	1	1	-1	3

I admit that I had a negative about TI based solely on the reviews that I had read on trip advisor. On arrival, we went to the front desk to see if there was a petite suite available for early check-in. The lady that helped us with our reservation was very nice and helpful. I believe that she was the manager as she was able to get us into a room, and she also gave us several 2 for 1 coupons for drinks and buffets as well as a complimentary bottle of champagne since we were there celebrating our 7th anniversary. We were able to check in, but our reservation was for a suite with 2 bathrooms with one having a jetted tub. The room we checked into was a handicap room without the jetted tub. All it took was a call to the front desk and preparations were made for us to get to into right room. We were allowed to stay in the handicap room until the regular suite was ready. Had a room with a view of the mountains and the fashion show mall which was perfectly fine since i didn't go to sit in my room and look out of the window. We were finally able to check into &quot;our&quot; room about normal check-in time. As far as being swept off of my feet with the splendor of this hotel, didn't happen. Overall I was very pleased with our stay at TI and would stay here again and recommend friends/family to give it a try. Now I come to my only complaint. I had done my research of restaurants and used my knowledge from prior trip to Vegas to come up with a plan to not go broke on the overpriced food there. TI buffet........Not nasty but not great. We ate here twice only for convenience and because of the 2-for-1 coupons we had. 1st time in we went for a late lunch and the food was so-so and the service sucked. The waiter we had, i believe his name was Thahn??? was more concerned with cleaning off dirty tables than waiting on his patrons. I usually am very lenient and it takes REALLY bad service for me to say something. This guy was blatantly rude to the table next to us and never came to fill our drinks, not even once. I didn't confront him, but i went to fill my own glass and another waitress gladly filled it for me. Not impressed at all, I tipped the waitress for the service but left Thahn nothing but a dirty table. To top it all off, he had the nerve to come by after we got up to look for a tip. 2nd trip was better service wise and the food tasted better but still not worth the price they charge. This time, I got the chance to voice my displeasure with my service from Thahn and requested not to sit in his section. We didn't eat at Gilley's, but the have awesome daily drink specials ie, 2-for-1 shots of crown royal. Kahunaville is a great party bar and have a decent breakfast for $7.99. If you try it and don't like it, there is a Denny's across from the Mirage at Casino Royale. Not impressed with the siren's show but it was something to do for free. Siren's Sip bar was pricey, but they don't give you watered down drinks. Went to the pool once, but only to say I went to the pool and to get a drink at the bar. Great location and value. Last time out stayed at a 3-star, TI this time, and next trip out we plan to stay at a 5-star, but would gladly stay at TI again. Tip: If you want to knock off a few dollars off of meal prices at the buffets, go about 30 minutes from time to change. EX: If you want breakfast and lunch, go at 10:30 to catch the end of breakfast and the start of lunch and can get lunch for the breakfast price and the same between lunch and dinner. Cab fare is very expensive so I would recommend getting a 24 hour bus pass depending on how much travelling you plan to do. We paid $14 for a 24 hour pass and went to Fremont Street and anywhere on the strip. TIP*******If you are reserving any type of suite, be prepared for them to hold a $400 deposit for any &quot;damages&quot; that may occur. You can give them cash and receive $100 dollars back per day if there aren't any damages or you use any services. Yes they do charge a $22.50 PER DAY resort fee	5	-1	-1	-1	5	4	-1	5

We were up on the 32nd floor, and the view was literally breathtaking. The hotelroom was very nice and clean, and the bed was really comfy. Nice bathroom. For the price we paid - the room is absolutely worth being rated as &quot;excellent&quot;.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the hotel - we liked the pool area. It was crowded, and the atmposphere was very festive. Great for people in their early/mid twenties. The casino area was a bit too cold for our taste - a stark contrast to the hot temperatures outside. (Bring a jacket to wear inside.) Casino guests also smoke cigarettes inside - so people with strong allergies might want to book a hotel without a casino. (Our rooms were of course non smoking - so the cigarette issue only applies to the lobby and casino area on the first floor.)<br/><br/>The restaurants at the hotel were quite expensive, but the food was super good. (Especially at the Italian steak house.) The service was great. The breakfast options were not equally good. (Slow service and average food.)<br/><br/>We enjoyed our stay at T.I.

I have stayed there before and had a pleasant experience and decided to stay there again as the price was good. I got there late Sunday afternoon and the check in line was not long, but took awhile to get through. it was not the desk workers fault, but the guests trying to check in. Finally got to check in and the girl was very nice and asked if I preferred a floor on lower level or upper and if I preferred being near the elevator.<br/>My only surprise at check in was the $20 a day resort fee. I asked what this was she explained that this gave access to the gym, wireless internet in the room (basically items I was not going to use). Also got coupons for 2 for 1 buffet, a free shot and drink at Kahunaville (a restaurant/bar in TI), and $20 off a future stay. <br/><br/>My room was nice with a view of the strip. When I got to the room the bed was not made and had dirty linens. The rest of the room was very clean. I called housekeeping and a housekeeper was there to strip the bed within 15 minutes. She apologized profusely and was very nice. Overall, I was very impressed with the room. The bed was very soft and the pillows were very full and fluffy. The comforter was very thick and comfortable. I slept very well and was not awakened by anyone stumbling down the hall late at night/early morning. <br/><br/>Treasure Island has many restaurants to choose from with moderate to expensive prices. The Coffee Shop located near the front of the casino is open 24 hours and serves breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc at all times. Very good food too. Average prices is about $15.00 per person. Canter's Deli is nice too and about $15 average for a sandwhich, drink, and chips. Also ate at Gilley's. It is a roadhouse style restaurant located inside TI. Again, the average price is about $15, but the portions of food are quite large and the service was excellent. Kahunaville was lots of fun! The bartenders throw the bottles around and compete for applause. I went there every night and it was always a good time. Service could be a bit slow at times, especially when it got really packed and busy. Still, that did not deter from my enjoyment. <br/><br/>I rented a cabana at the TI pool. A VERY good value too. You get the cabana from 1-5, but they let you stay until 8:00 if you wish. The price was $90 and it came with a very well stocked refrigerator and a server is available to bring alcoholic beverages and food if you wish. The pool was a bit small, but there were many chairs around the pool and plenty places to get some sun. <br/><br/>Housekeeping came to the room everyday and did an excellent job cleaning the room. They were very friendly and quite courteous. Very willing to leave extra towels, etc. My only complaint about TI is the $20 a day resort fee. Other hotels do not charge this fee, but TI and all other hotels owned by the same company charge it. be sure to read the fine print if when you book so you are not surpried. I gave TI a very good instead of an excellent because of the resort fee. I would stay there again, however, since it is so close to everything and is located in the middle of the strip! I did not go to the Sirens of TI show as I have seen it before. If you have your room key, you can go to a special viewing area just for guests of TI instead of having to stand with people just passing by. One thing I forgot to mention is that the safe in the room was not working. Not a big deal, but just wanted to share that.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

The pirate ship show was fun to watch. The beds are fabulous...so comfortable. There is a small refrigerator in the room to keep bottled water or drinks cold. Walgreen's is across the street, so it's convenient to purchase the extra water to keep you hydrated in the Vegas heat. The casino is well laid out and the waitresses are friendly and keep the drinks coming. . Other casinos are within walking distance if you want to check out the other casinos or nightly shows. Great parking if you rent a car. Room elevators are easy to access.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

It's in a great location, close to everything.<br/>We had an issue with water - it seems that there was an incident that caused the running water in the entire hotel to shut down for about 6 or 7 hours. I was showered, my boyfriend was not - so it was a little uncomfortable. The hotel didn't call or let us know and they were very stingy with the discount they gave us - something like $30 off the entire stay. <br/><br/>However, I have to think it was a fluke and the rest of the stay was wonderful. Saw the Mystere show and loved that too! Great romantic weekend away.	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1

Front desk assured that the housekeeping manager would address the situation -- this never happened and she sent the attendant instead.<br/><br/>Even better was the urine stains on the bottom basin of toilet that were left uncleaned till the last full day of our trip. This was probably worse than the stained bottom sheets on the bed. I don't care how many AAA Four Diamond awards you've won since 1993, this needs to be known in a public forum when decided where to spend your hard earned money on a vacation hotel. <br/><br/>Location of the property is great but the pool and public areas leave much to be desired. If you are considering this price range and location go next-door to the Mirage and enjoy so much more at little to no cost difference with enough planning.	3	-1	-1	-1	1	3	-1	3

The rooms are NOT as they seem from the pics displayed on external sites such as Expedia.com, the air conditioning flow is non existent in the room, yet you would think this would be a priority for a hotel based in the Nevada desert but no...<br/><br/>2. My bed was sub standard with a mattress akin to an egg carton sleeping became a chore. This mattress should be donated to Guantanamo bay.<br/><br/>3. No hairdryer in the bathroom, along with a bible in the drawer I always thought this was a given in hotel rooms of 3 starts or more.... apparently not.<br/><br/>4. Being woke at 9am by housekeeping knocking on your door, little more needs to be said rather than unprofessional.<br/><br/>5. If we needed a cold drink of water from the vending machine on our floor well that was out of the question not once was it working for the duration of our stay.<br/><br/>6. If you want breakfast at Treasure Island I suggest taking out a 2nd mortage, we had breakfast there 1 morning. I ordered a platter of fruit and my friend a Turkey sandwich 35mins later with service you get at McDonalds we recieved our $40 bill, I am sure even the people offering the &quot;Girls in 20 mins service&quot; on the strip offer cheaper goods/services.<br/><br/>7. To use the internet is $10 for 10mins that is highway robbery, you would think the $20 resort fees would cover using the computers in the business centre but no.<br/><br/>All in all very dissapointed in our stay.	1	-1	-1	-1	2	1	-1	1

I've never been to Vegas before so I am unable to compare this with other hotels, but that seemed quite long.<br/><br/>When I reserved my room online I marked that I wanted one King size bed and close to the elevator. I got two Queen size beds in a room that was the furthest from the elevator. I was told I could switch rooms the next day, but the check in line was out the door so I decided to skip it. <br/><br/>The room was very nice, I couldn't hear anything in there. I couldn't here the people above me or beside me. I didn't have the best view, I was overlooking Macy's, but I could see some mountains in the distance.

We had booked two rooms at $38.00 per night on Southwest Vacations. It seemed like a good rate; despite the $22.40 ??esort fee?I knew they?? tack on. Still, it was my youngest daughter?? 21st birthday and she and her mother didn?? want to stay downtown (my usual choice) or off-strip (worked great when my son turned 21), so this seemed to be a good value for a center strip location for the family. <br/><br/>A request for a complimentary upgrade at check-in got our rooms hoisted up the mast from the 4th to the 29th with a knockout strip view. I, of course, showed my appreciation to the thoughtful clerk. Bell service was quick and efficient. Once again, I normally wouldn?? use a bellman, but there were five of us in the family and the three women do not travel light. <br/><br/>The rooms were adequately spacious with very nice, large bathrooms. The tub was the standard fiberglass tub/shower combo, which was serviceable. Toiletries provided were of excellent quality if you don?? mind showering with soap whose fragrance makes you feel like your showering with a half a grapefruit. <br/><br/>The pillows made me want to phone the house just to talk to one of the ones I left behind. They were about as comfortable as a pile of balsa wood. The room drapes,however, worked well enough to block out the sun for afternoon naps, but after having my sleep disturbed by the constant thumping sound of what I thought was the party on the pool deck, I discovered on leaving the room that the sound was coming from the room across the hall. I was flabbergasted that people actually listen to that kind of music voluntarily. I had in mind to disturb their sleep in the early morning hours the next day, but missed the opportunity, as they spent most of the night quarrelling in the hall and slamming doors. Cant?really blame TI for hosting an urban hillbilly convention. The clientele at Four Queens or Palace Station outclasses this bunch by miles, IMHO.<br/><br/>We ate at the aptly named ??offee Shop?a number of times due to its convenience, not its affordable prices. Quality was acceptable, but well below the fine dining prices they charge. The Kanter?? Deli, on the other hand, was a real bright spot. Excellent food and affordable prices. It?? got a bit of a fast food joint vibe, but the quality was excellent and we all returned on a number of occasions.<br/><br/>We had one breakfast at the buffet, as we were going to print out our return flight boarding passes and the location was near the free kiosk. About what you?? expect from a typical buffet on the Vegas strip these days ?unremarkable selections and prices you wish would hearken back to the days of truly cheap buffets. We weren?? surprised by anything, including the slow, indifferent service.<br/><br/>On the whole, a decent stay that met our expectations for a center strip property.	3	-1	-1	-1	4	3	-1	3

When checked in received a non-smoking room when requested a smoking, however they did offer to switch us to a smoking room the next day and we chose not to move as our room had used Q-tips on the surround around the tube and the other couple that stayed with us had old food left in their room upon checking in.

We are frequent flyers to Las Vegas and usually stay at the Mirage or Wynn about four times a year. This trip, In celebration of our anniversary, we wanted to go back to where we stayed on our very first trip to Las Vegas nine years ago - Treasure Island. Wow, what a dissapointment. The check in line was so long, we decided to go the the pool and check in later. I kept checking throughout the day but the line was always very long and not moving. After a 30 minute wait at 8pm we finally got our room key. Hey, I understand that sometimes things get busy or computer systems are slow - I don't mind waiting - WHEN THE WAIT IS FOR SOMETHING OF VALUE. Unfortunately, this place is not the classy joint it was once, more like a 2.5 star hotel downtown in &quot;old vegas.&quot; This hotel has slidden in character, quality, and cleanliness and is definately not the on par with others at this end of the block. Maybe they have struggled with cut-backs and can no longer place emphasis or attention to cleanliness and the little details like dirty grout around tub, hair in shower, dust in corners of room etc..The pool was disgusting - dirty chairs, everyone in pool drinking heavily but amazingly no one seemed to be leaving to go to bathroom after their six beers???? Throw up in bushes yuk! Really, it was 105 so everyone was in pool (standing room only) for a designated pool party which apparantly is held every Saturday with a DJ. I was embarrassed for the little kids as they were forced into the hot tub to swim and avoid college age girls gone bad all up on each other dancing provocatively or standing on edge of pool rubbing their thong clad buts all over the guys sitting in the pool. There is a time and place for this - like at the private party pools offered at other resorts or spring break in Cancun. If I had know this would be what I was paying for I would have just gone to Mirage to enjoy the pool. If you are a college student who's coming to Vegas to get drunk, act crazy, and party hard you may really like this type of place. We will never stay here again.	2	-1	-1	-1	1	2	-1	3

Had read horror stories about check in experience, but arrived at 2pm and the check in line was short and had room keys in under 20 minutes. We reserved two rooms due to large number of people in party. We had requested adjoining rooms but were not guaranteed. Thankfully they were able to accomodate without any difficulty. There was a lady at check in having a meltdown over the resort fee, claiming she knew nothing about it. There seemed to be plenty of notice on the website concerning the resort fee, so I'm left wondering how she missed it. <br/><br/>The rooms appeared clean at first, but upon closer inspection, several areas appeared to be overlooked routinely during housekeeping. There was plenty of dust on almost all of the surfaces that aren't commonly used. Long black hairs were found on the tile in the shower of one room, and the previous guest's leftover food was discovered in the refrigerator . The mattresses we comfortable, however, and the rooms were fairly quiet. Checkout was uneventful, accomplished over the phone with a clerk.	3	-1	-1	-1	1	3	-1	4

In fact, there is plenty to do in Vegas for families and this was our second trip. However, it is important that you choose appropriate accomodation and the Treasure Island hotel is definitely targeting singles and couples looking to use the casino and/or party, party. It is not family orientated at all.<br/> We paid minimum price for two rooms at the last minute over their website and both rooms were large and comfortable. However, there was a very long queue to check in (and out) and the service, in general, was effective enough, but not at all friendly. The pool area is large but it's impossible to swim in the pool because it quickly gets packed with partygoers wandering around with massive cocktails in hand. That is not a criticism, it just wasn't the hotel for us. Location is good though, just at the north end of the strip.<br/> Nothing really wrong with the Treasure Island, particularly if you are young and single. Rooms are not luxurious, but they are cheap. Service is not great but, again, you get what you pay for. For a family, go elsewhere. I would recommend a one bed apartment at the Signature at the MGM Grand. About the same price as two rooms at the Treasure Island.	4	-1	-1	-1	3	2	-1	3

It fit the bill to a tee. It was my first time in Las Vegas. We rented a car and went all over the strip and it was nice since parking at the hotels is free. My only complaint is how far you have to walk from all of the lots to the actual hotel. For the price Treasure Island was fine. If I were going again, I would stay at the Venetian, which was beautiful. The restaurants in TI were good, especially the buffet. Pizza was expensive. The pirate show outside was impressive. We got tickets for Donny and Marie, which we loved. They gave out free tickets for the Nathan Burton show. That show was fantastic.

That said, rooms and common areas are always impeccably maintained and the beds are comfortable. Bathrooms are a nice size. Views are always good and you are across the street from Venetian, Palazzo and a foot bridge aways from the Fashion Show Mall which has an excellet Starbucks if you don't feel like spending four bucks for a venti at the hotel Starbucks. The hotel eateries are good and while not cheap, the food is reliable and tasty. The coffee shop has good breakfast with most plates costing between $10 -$14.pp. This hotel gets a nice crowd and doesn't feel as &quot;party ready&quot; as others on the strip, e.g., Planet Hollywood,	4	-1	-1	-1	5	4	-1	4

We booked through Expedia and even with resort fees it was very affordable, especially compared to other hotels. Check-in took maybe 10 minutes with the wait. We checked out on Friday, waiting time was about 20 minutes, so if headed to airport leave yourself some extra time.<br/>We had friends with us so they were given a room on the same floor which was really nice. Their room had a view of North strip right above Sirens of TI show.<br/>Room was clean, view was outstanding. Staff was very friendly! Only two minor complaints with the hotel. Casino is darker than most, and pool closed at 8 p.m. so never got to enjoy it. After a lot of walking all day that can really be missed in the evenings.<br/>Hotel is middle of the strip so easy access to all Vegas has to offer. Beds were the best I'd ever slept in! Even compared to mine at home. 24 hour Walgreens across the street so it's nice if you've forgotten anything for your trip. Or to get a little cooler to take snacks to room with you. Hotel food is expensive. Better offers out on the strip. We did have breakfast at &quot;The Coffee Shop&quot; at TI. It was pricey but good.<br/>All in all, I'd stay here again.

This was for the top sales individuals across the nation. <br/>The check in time is 3 pm. I arrived in LV at 3:20, went directly to the hotel to check in for my 6 pm dinner. The check-in line was long and slow with 5 hotel staff checking people in, two to check people out, a VIP clerk and 2 managers standing in the back talking. At first, this was annoying but okay, since the line was moving, but one by one, the staff checking people in left the line. Still 2 staff to check people out (no one), 1 VIP and 2 managers talking. After 25 mins, it was down to one person checking the line of people in. Reminder - this is peak check in time. I called the front desk while waiting in line and was given the pleasant excuse &quot;we are doing our best, this is all we have staffed and give us some time&quot; BS from a front desk receptionist. I called again and asked to speak to a front desk manager - who started to say that there were more than one person checking people in (he was looking at the camera) and when I called him on it and mentioned the managers who might pitch in, he said he would look into it. Miraculously, hotel staff, including managers, started showing up and the check out staff started helping check people in. <br/>My question: if check in time is 3 pm - shouldn't the hotel staff enough people to check in during their peak time quickly to start gambling and spending money? And if the front desk manager had a camera to view the lines, shouldn't he have recognized and acted on the fact that there was a crowd to provide customer service? <br/>When I finally got my room key, I got to my room which was worn and not so clean.<br/>If given the choice, it would not be TI.	2	-1	-1	-1	2	1	-1	2

Since we visit Las Vegas to do a variety of things, our preference for a hotel is an affordable and centrally located place with one or two restaurants, and possibly a show. Treasure Island fits us. We have always been welcomed with smiling faces and courtesy - all the staff members have made our stay enjoyable. On this visit the TV was going crazy - we had it on for the news while getting ready to hit the town. It was changing stations on it's own. Called the maintenence department and within 5 minutes a tech was there, and fixed the problem within 10 minutes. That's service. Our rooms have overlooked the Strip and it's a great view. The rooms are very clean and have plenty of towels. We have eaten at the Noodle Restaurant, the Cafe that is open all night (it seems) and the buffet for breakfast (great variety and good quality). We have seen Mystere' and it is really a great show. The hotel gives several coupons and 2 for 1 tickets offers and really are valuable. Love getting free Starbucks in the morning. The Sirens show is a little cheesy, but enjoyable if you have not seen it before - as a guest of TI you get preference seating for the show. Planning another trip the end of the year, and we will book at TI.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	4	-1	4

The only lights in the ceiling are in the bathrooms, so if your first entry into the room is during the night like ours was use your cellphone to light your way to a lamp. The are no light switches on the wall except in the bathroom and one that hightlights a picture hanging on the wall. The room is equiped with a large sectional couch, coffee table, dining table with two chairs and an office area with an desk and a blue wire for direct internet hookup. We just used their wifi and it was terrific. ?You do have to go through a few pages and notifications once you attempt to log into the web. ?Remmeber that your daily resort fee covers your internet usage cost so don't be confused by the payment screen. ?Just select 24 hour use and breeze right on in. ?The bed is comfortable and comes with lots of pillows of various types. ?Even with the AC set as cool as it would go, if you leave the drapes open during the day your room will heat-up rather quickly. ?The Tower Suite comes with a his and her bathroom. ?His is a one sink, shower only and toliet variety, that has its own closet. ?Her's is a larger bathroom fitted with one sink, toliet, whirlpool tub and a walkin closet. ?They store their hairdryers, one in each bathroom, in the top racks in their respective closets. ?The switch to turn on the jets to the whirlpool tub are located on the wall behind the entry door into the bathroom. ?Turn the timer on before you jump in the water or you will be jumping out wet to turn it on. ?This room compairs with some of the better suites in Vegas. There are a few suites that we have stayed at that I liked better and a few other suites that was'nt quiet as good as this one at TI. The only other thing that i can add about our stay is the tusk of a woolly mamouth that has been carved out and deplicts the life of the village of the artist. ?I've been to Vegas more than 15 times and this is the first time that i have noticed the tusk....really cool. So, to sum up our stay, if you catch a deal for a tower suite give it a shot as it is in line with some of the better suites on the Strip.	4	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	4

We thought the quality of the room to be 1st class, especially considering the price paid. We opted to book the hotel direct on their web site using one of their Summer special promotion rates. This also had a 2-for-one deal at their buffet which was pretty good.<br/><br/>Our room's view of the Strip was great. We also had a view straight down to the pool. Speaking of the pool, we chose to swim in the pool first thing in the morning before it got too crowded and still had long shadows to give some relief from the June sun. <br/><br/>Elevators are well thought out with several sets dedicated to serving higher floors, resulting in less wait times.<br/><br/>But, the hotel is not perfect. Check-in times are ridiculous as was the long walk with your bags from the self-parking garage through the casino to the check-in desks. Maybe, if you were to choose vallet parking, this task could be easier. Charges for using the WI-FI was way too high. The room's lounge was pretty to look at, but very uncomfortable<br/><br/>Three years ago, we stayed at the Flamingo close by, so we couldn't help but compare the two properties. All things considered, it was hard to separate them. But maybe, just maybe, the Flamingo won out. At the Flamingo we stayed in a Go room with a great view of the Bellagio fountains. Decor was a bit more gaudy, but the room was bigger. The Flamingo's landscaping and pools were better as well.<br/><br/>This was our fourth trip to Vegas, and hopefully not the last. Would we stay at the TI again? There are so many choices . . . Maybe. We would have to check out what deals were going first.	4	-1	-1	-1	5	3	-1	5

Valet was quick, check in was quick, and we were given a lovely strip-view room on the 26th floor. Our room was recently renovated and quite nice. The room was very clean, the bed was very comfortable, and there was ample closet and drawer space. I thoroughly checked the bed and mattress for any signs of bed bugs and found a very clean, new mattress with very clean linens. The bathroom was a great size, with a large tub/shower and a large vanity. The shower had very good water pressure and was very clean. I was very impressed. This hotel is much nicer than others in the same price category on the strip such as the Tropicana, Excalibur, NYNY, and Luxor. <br/><br/>At check-in we were given a couple of coupons that we used. One was a 2-for-1 buffet coupon. The buffet was okay, but not great. The other was a 2-for-1 cocktail coupon, which we used at Kahunaville. Kahunaville was having some type of contest between the bartenders and it was insanely loud, and we left quickly. However, the drinks and appetizers there were good.<br/><br/>The Starbucks onsite is more than 2x the price of any Starbucks I have been in, but they were quick and efficient in moving the long line. We also ate a late meal at Gilley's one night that was good but pricey. <br/><br/>We didn't try the pool because it was raining all day on the day we planned to go. From our room we could see it, and it looked rather small and crowded. <br/><br/>The views from this hotel are great. From our room we had an amazing view of the Mirage volcano and could see all the way up the strip. The location is also great - with a bridge over to the fashion mall and another bridge to the Palazzo/Venetian. And we really appreciated that this hotel isn't a mega-resort, so you can walk from one side to the other within a couple of minutes instead of the 15 minutes it takes at places like Mandalay Bay and the MGM Grand. Because it is a smaller hotel the table limits were also lower ($10 on Saturday night instead of the average $15 - $25 minimums on the strip), which we really liked. <br/><br/>Check-out required just the push of one button our TV remote and we were done. It doesn't get easier than that! <br/><br/>The only thing that made me choose &quot;Very Good&quot; for this hotel instead of &quot;Excellent&quot; is the high resort fee of $22.40 per day. They include several things that most people going to Vegas won't use, like access to the fitness center, a morning newspaper (that you have to go get yourself downstairs), internet access in the room, a couple of coupons, and a $20 coupon to use &quot;next time&quot;. When booking this hotel online, remember to add this fee into the nightly rate to get your true cost. <br/><br/>Overall, a great room for a great price!!	4	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

She chose TI because of the location and because it had a fun atmosphere. We stood in line for an hour before we were finally checked in and on our way to our rooms. The staff was friendly, but they could have used more staff members during the peak check-in time period (we arrived between 2:30 to 3 pm). <br/><br/>I selected the deluxe room without a strip view. My room was comfortable, clean, and had all of the basic requirements. There were no bells &amp; whistles, but I didn't come to Vegas to stay in my room. I had one maintenance issue during my stay and it was handled seamlessly. <br/><br/>The resort's Player's Club had some nice perks. I recieved $5 free play for providing my email and an additional $5 (you have an opportunity to win between $5 to $500) in slot play just for signing up. 99% of my play was at TI so I received many perks during my stay (free food credits, more slot play, etc.). <br/><br/>We ate at Kahunaville 3 times and I enjoyed every meal. Their drinks are unbelieveably good! We also ate at Isla for dinner one night (best Chicken Enchilada's ever!), the coffee shop, and The Buffet (loved the breakfast buffet! $4 to add unlimited champagne on Thursday! Can't beat that!). <br/><br/>I plan to return again soon!	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

When we walked into the room we were pleasantly surprised. Two huge his and hers bathrooms with marble floors and counter tops were located on both sides of the hallway entering the room. The suite had floor-to-ceiling windows, a large flat screen TV, a large queen pillowtop bed with lighted and padded headboard, a sofa and chair, and a large desk. The bed was so comfortable! House keeping staff kept the room spotless, and all hotel employees were very polite and helpful. This was our first stay at TI and we will stay again for sure in another petite suite. Well worth the extra cost to upgrade from a regular room.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

The hotel was top of the line. Was not too please with the resort fees but overall the quality of the hotel made up for it. I would come back again it's a prime location.

I did miss this on the website at booking time but the lady that checked us in was less than friendly or accomodating on this matter. It was entirely my fault for missing the information but she was incredibly rude when we questioned what the fee was for. Once up to our room, it was as pictured on the website, but it was missing a few things. There was no bedskirt on the bed, just an exposed dirty dingy boxspring. Our bedsheet was a flat sheet that did not go all the way to the end of the bed, there was about 1 foot of exposed mattress. Part of he bathroom lights did not work, an entire side of the lights were burnt out, and it just happened to be the side that had the plug ins. We did not recieve our turn down serive 2 out of the 3 nights we stayed at the hotel. The final day of our stay we decided to use the complimentary self check in machine for our airline tickets. When we tried to print our tickets the computers were out of paper. There is no courtesy phones and no way to contact hotel staff. There was another hotel guest trying to print her forms too and we sent her companion to the front desk (which by the way is on the entirely opposite side of the hotel) When she returned, she said the lady at the desk told her that she did not know where her manager was and that she did not know how long it would take to get to us with paper, We waited so long that our session timed out. We went to the guest services desk and after seeing a LONG line up at the computers at the front, I polietly asked the guest services staff if she could please print our tickets for us, as we had already spent over an hour messing about with the printers being out of paper and having to loose our info and start over. She flatly declined and told us we would have to wait. Upon check out, the gentleman asked us if we enjoyed our stay. I said &quot;no, we did not&quot;. He proceeded to ask my husband for our room keys and info, and then asked him for his credit card info. He did not even acknowledge my response. I decided to take it up on myself to tell him all the above mentioned issues and he flat out ignored me and took full payment for our room. After my husband said in disgust that he would never stay at this establishment again, the gentleman pretended not to hear or understand him 3 times. My husbands english is perfect and his voice is loud so there was no way the gentleman did not understand him. The ENTIRE hotel smelled very strongly of smoke, even up in our rooms, despite them being non smoking rooms. I realize that there is little to be done about ventialation issues but even the stratosphere had better ventilation, once you left their casion it did not smell. Overall, we were so unhappy with our experience. We payed for a 4 star hotel but recieved 1 star service. After returning from our trip, I emailed the hotel and asked for it to be forwarded to the hotel manager, documenting everything I mentioned above. It is now July, our trip was mid May, and I still have not recieved a response. On a positive note, the beds were very comfy and the pool area was nice.	1	-1	-1	-1	1	1	-1	4

Somewhat dumpy, dated and stinky ...	3	3	I've stayed at a handful of hotels in Vegas over the past 3 years (Excalibur, Monte Carlo, Vdara, Wynn and Mirage) and Treasure Island is certainly average - at best - compared to the other hotels in its class on the strip. My frame of reference of course is only the ones I've stayed at, which range from 3 to 5 star.<br/><br/>The ventilation system through the hotel and casino is very poor, so the stench of cigarettes that normally hovers over the casino area also permeates the hotel floor hallways. The carpets in the hotel floors are dirty, and the ones in the rooms are only marginally better. <br/><br/>The casino area is small (it's a small hotel though, so that's to be expected) but looks very dated and dirty (empty glasses &amp; garbage around the machines aren't picked up often, floors are dirty...).<br/><br/>As for the rooms themselves, they're pretty standard. They've been renovated somewhat superficially ... example: the bathroom has granite countertops and newer sinks, but the shower head looked like it's from 1940 and is so heavily covered in caked on hard water &amp; calcium build up that the jets of water coming out are strong enough to scratch out your skin!<br/><br/>I also question cleanliness - the bathroom floor wasn't washed during our stay, the bathroom had mold along the floors and the base of the bath tub, the closet floor had seemingly never been vacuumed - and one of the chairs in the bedroom was covered in mystery stains.<br/><br/>On the good side, the beds are fairly comfortable, the furniture has been mostly updated and of course, it is well situated on the strip. If you enjoy shopping, the pedestrian walkway to the fashion show mall is connected directly to the hotel.<br/><br/>The pool is just average, the restaurants at the hotel are also just average - not bad, but definitely not great. Service at the hotel (check-in, concierge, valet and players club) is again, pretty average.<br/><br/>I would not be keen to stay here again, unless it was at a ridicilously cheap rate. There are far superior hotels on the trip to stay at for the same - and lower - price.	3	-1	-1	-1	2	3	-1	3

I spoke to supervisors and a so called manager that continued to make matters worse and were not open to a resolution. I would have taken a simple apology.<br/><br/>In the end they offended me more by not following through on my original room request of a king bed and decided for me that 2 queen beds were more fitting for us.<br/><br/>Treasure island should take note by other hotels like Wynn and Encore that realize the potential business from all guests and have dedicated resources for gay and lesbian travelers. Poor decisions and behavior on the part of ignorant and insensitive employees with no clue.	3	4	-1	3	4	2	-1	-1

Nice hotel, the rooms are clean with modern decoration. The buffet was average, did not have a lot to choose and the quality was merely OK. The pool is kind of small for such a big hotel. One thing that we found upsetting was the woman from housekeeping tried to get into our room very early (before 9am) and she did not even announce herself. Just knocked once and tried to open the door. Fortunately, we always locked the door. The hotel has a Tram that connects you with The Mirage.<br/>The Spa was good, very relaxing. The Jacuzzi, Steam room area was very quite and private. Overall it is a good hotel but maybe next time we would try others.	4	-1	-1	-1	4	3	-1	4

The room was fine. We paid extra for a view room that overlooked the pool area and views of the south Las Vegas Blv. I liked that the beds were comfy with lots of pillows. Also, the comforters on the beds were fresh and clean, instead of some sketchy bedspread. The bathroom was spacious and clean, with sufficient soap and hair products that were replenished everyday. Be aware that the haIr dryer is on the shelf in the closet! We didn't use the pool, but from our view, it was packed by noon. Check-in was a bit long, and then we were hit with the $22.00 daily resort fee(somehow, we missed that when we booked through Southwest).The buffet was pretty blah, but you get a two for one coupon w/ check-in. The coffee shop served a nice breakfast, but nothing special at around 12 dollars. Gambling was good there, compared to other places where we tried our luck. All in all, there's other places I's like to stay, so doubt we'll be back.	3	-1	-1	-1	4	3	-1	4

PROS: The bed was soooooo comfortable. Room Service was quite fast for delivery. The Jacuzzi was wonderful. The view from the 36th floor was picturesque. The elevators were limited to only certain floors, so no long rides waiting to go up or down. The machines were great. CONS: The buffet served THE EXACT same food over 3 meals. Change it up a little. Housekeeping showed up at 8 am! <br/><br/>After 2 nights in the casino, the Players Club comped all of our meals, leaving only the tip and the resort fee on our credit card. So that was really cool too. We will come to the TI again.	4	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	5

I'm not sure how this hotel justifies a &quot;resort fee&quot; (aka hidden charge) of $20 + tax per night when there are 5-star hotels like the Venetian / Palazzo that only charge $17 / night and offer 5-star amenities. In fact no Las Vegas hotel that I know of charges a resort fee of more than $20 / night and I have no idea how the TI feels that they can be at the highest end.<br/><br/>The room itself was clean and the beds are comfortable, but the dealers have no personality and the pool staff turned snotty when I asked for 2 towels.

I stayed at TI with a group of 7 girls for my 24th birthday. Luckily, one of my friends was apart of the Player's Club, which otherwise would not have influenced my choice to stay at the hotel. Like many other reviewers have noted, the check-in line is HORRENDOUS, with them only having two or three people working at the front desk and a line snaking the lobby and spilling into the casino. Player's Club line was probably 10 minutes tops wait-so if you're staying here, get with the PC.<br/><br/>One star for the front desk agent that helped me out. She was very understanding and didn't get annoyed when I wanted to change our room, went through the process but then had to back out because people in my party didn't want to switch. She also gave us comp champagne for our room for my birthday! <br/><br/>One star for amenities. I expected that for being renovated the hotel would loook better, and I was right. the halls and rooms were clean and nicely decorated. The bed was unusually comfortable, but not the most comfortable I've ever been in. <br/><br/>Minus stars for the small and uneventful pool. Good for those that want to chill and actually swim, not good at all for those that want to drink and party. Also minus for the room service, which took over 20 minutes and two calls to get an extra set of towels. Another negative for them not having rooms cleaned up in a timely manner. Since our party was checking in at different times, the first party there checked into both rooms at once. I wanted connecting rooms but they didn't have ANY cleaned up in time-which in my opinion isn't acceptable for a hotel. <br/><br/>More minuses for the resort fee and location. Unless you're planning on shopping, and/or only interested in spending at the Wynn/Encore/Venitian/Palazzo then the hotel location is quite inconvenient.	3	-1	-1	-1	4	3	-1	4

We also appreciated the TV internet access (a bit slow, yes, but very handy). The casino itself is indeed smaller than others, which makes it very easy to get around and to get to your room. We liked the atmosphere and had a great time gambling in TI, and also regularly took advantage of the free tram to the Mirage. <br/><br/>As far as dining options go, we frequented Kahunaville (great food, awesome bar) and also dined at the Mexican restaurant Isla, which was a bit higher end and very nice. We ate at Gilly's but didn't enjoy that as much, however I admit it was a great atmosphere there.<br/><br/>The general area in which TI is located is my personal favourite part of the strip - a short walk to Mirage (or tram ride!), the Venetian and the Fashion show mall is connected by a walkway. It is also easy to walk to Caeser's, Harrah's etc.<br/><br/>Another good aspect about TI is the price - generally a lot better value for money than similar hotels.

We did upgrade to a strip view and we actually had what they call a panaromic view of the strip. It was a great updated modern room that was plenty large and comfortable. We did have a great view of the nightly pirate show from our room &amp; enjoyed the VIP section for outside viewing also. The location of the hotel is very convenient to everything which is one of the reasons we stayed here. This is our 4th trip to Vegas &amp; we have stayed in a different hotel each time. I was not disappointed with this hotel &amp; I would recommend it for people on a budget. The only complaint I could mention was the check in process. We checked in on a Sunday afternoon &amp; the line was so long it took us 35 minutes. They did give us a complimentary bottle of champagne delivered to our room.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	4	-1	5

Even tho booked in advance they only allocate the rooms when you check in The outside of the hotel is getting quite grotty needs a good clean around the entrance . we hired a car for a day and drove to the hoover dam about 30 min drive went online looked up avis they have a agency at the Pallazzo hotel across the road walked over the over pass outside TI down escalator by Walgreens and straight to the Pallazzo Picked up car dropped off same place easy. This hotel is well priced considering its location on the strip Been here twice would try another property if we come back.	5	-1	-1	-1	3	4	-1	5

When we arrived at the hotel about 7pm, we had to stand in line for over an hour to check in. There should be a seperate line for reservations or a kiosk to check in at. There are no bathrooms around the check in desk and people were leaving the line and the trying to cut back in upon their return. All of that was a major hassle. The front desk was woefully understaffed, although the clerk we had was very friendly. The resort fee was a scam since we didn't do anything at the &quot;resort&quot;.<br/><br/>We attempted to go to our room but we had to change elevators twice because only certain elevators go to certain floors. That was very confusing. Once we got to our room it was very nice and clean. The view was ok but we didn't spring for a room with a view of the strip. Check out was simple, just put your room cards in the box on the way out. We'd stay there again but we would check in earlier so the crowd would be less.	3	-1	-1	-1	5	4	-1	5

There was a deli buried way in the back of the casino--had the most humongous cold-cut sandwich (turkey, ham, pastrami, and cheese double-decker) that also served as breakfast the next day. When we were there Cirque du Soleil was doing Mystere there--should have probably gone for that rather than Love...Oh, well...<br/><br/>On the whole, a reasonable choice for those who don't want to break the bank on a Vegas getaway....	4	-1	-1	-1	3	3	-1	4

The first time we were just stopping through Vegas and chose the hotel at random for a two-night stay. This time we preplanned the vacation and chose TI again for our four-night stay, Monday through Friday. Originally we had wanted to stay at a different hotel just because there are so many, why not try them all? But we quickly discovered we?? be hard pressed to find a hotel of the same caliber for the price. None of the hotels in the same price range seem to compare as far as cleanliness and location. (Even accounting for the service fee, which is high at $22.50 a night with tax, but those complaining about it need to realize even after you factor it in, TI is still a bargain, I think. Just be aware of it when you book so you won?? be surprised ?we were surprised by it during checkout the first time we stayed.) We were very pleased with our second stay at TI, and found only a few minor faults.<br/><br/>First of all, the rooms at TI are great. They are very clean and the d?cor is modern. (See my picture, it?? a standard deluxe room.) The beds ?sooooo comfortable (I had to make sure not to lay down during the day or I?? fall asleep!) I don?? know what happened with the people complaining about lack of maid service, because we actually didn?? want any, but every time we left our rooms the maids would politely ask when/if we wanted it cleaned. We said no thanks but could we grab some more TP and towels and they were fine with that. We kept the privacy sign on the whole trip and no one bothered us. We had a room facing the strip/pirates cove on the 34th floor and it was fantastic! (We didn?? pay for an upgrade, we just got lucky, and it probably didn?? hurt that we were very nice and joking around with the front desk guy. We did mention a top floor would be nice, and we got it.) We caught the Siren?? show from the room a couple times and it was cool watching the fireworks come up at you and explode in front of the window.<br/><br/>The casino at TI is also suitable. It?? not huge, but it has everything you would want if you just want to gamble a little before heading to bed, or in the morning, or anytime you feel the itch to play without walking the strip. The casino is also clean and the waitresses are plentiful and pretty quick with drinks (as long as you tip!) I disagree with the person who said it was poorly ventilated; as I, a non-smoker, was amazed at how many people I saw smoking when I never smelled it. (On the contrary, I smelled lots of smoke in other casinos.)<br/><br/>TI is also in a great location, one of the ??ess seedy?areas of the strip where you feel safe walking around at night (as safe as anywhere in Vegas, anyway). I?? still consider it the middle of the strip, though towards the north end, but I much prefer the north end to the south, which just feels a little less safe, and also the night we walked to NY, NY and back, less people were down at the north end (but more people trying to sell you stuff) and many more people were between the Bellagio and TI. The Sirens show is kind of lame but it must work for them as it attracts a lot of people to that part of the strip. Probably the best part of the location for us, though, is that it?? right across from a Walgreens, which we went to three times for various things because it has much cheaper snacks, souvenirs, and alcohol than any of the hotel shops ?very convenient!<br/><br/>The restaurants at TI are all great, though we had a little food poisoning going on after our first meal of stir-fry at Kahunaville. We still ate there again though, poolside for lunch, and both meals were delicious. (Don?? let me scare you, it was probably a fluke and I get food poisoning pretty easily, my boyfriend was only barely sick.) The buffet is pretty good, though expensive, and we ate there twice. (Used the 2-for-1 coupon for lunch the first full day, but I felt a little sick still from the bad Kahunaville, so I didn?? get to take full advantage of it. That?? why I decided to splurge and go back again the last night.) Go to the buffet pasta bar for sure, it was awesome, but be wary of the sushi, it didn?? seem too fresh. The buffet did have the best red velvet cupcake I??e ever eaten in my life. Isla was by far the best meal we had and I recommend going there, just make reservations. I?? a vegetarian and was pleased to see lots of veg options at all the restaurants. Being from the Midwest where it?? not so veg-friendly, I?? not used to that! We only had one bad experience, which was at the Coffee Shop where we waited 30 minutes for a check, along with four other tables; we were all looking at each other with confusion because we were all waiting on our checks and were stuck with no service! It was more weird than anything. Also, I was disappointed to find out at 6 am that the Starbucks doesn?? have hot breakfast, only drinks and pastries. There?? not really anywhere to grab hot food quick before 11 am.<br/><br/>Our only real complaint is with the pool area, and it?? not all bad, just not all that great either. We knew from the last time that TI had a small pool, but we figured it was okay because some of the hotels with larger pools also have more crowded pools because they are open to the public. However, this time the big problem was that the water was dirty and the area smelled of sulfur. Sitting in the water just felt slimy on Tuesday and Wednesday. Also, TI is pretty family friendly during the week, and so you have to be okay with tons of kids running around. It was annoying that on Wednesday the hot tub looked like the kiddy pool. There?? a sign saying that all children must be supervised and cannot be in the hot tub more than ten minutes, but no one enforces the rule, and there was a group of children standing on the top of the hot tub fountain splashing everyone with water for over at hour! And unless the one adult present was responsible for fourteen kids, I don?? think they were all closely supervised. Anyway, I think they must have cleaned the water between Wednesday and Thursday because on Thursday the water was colder and cleaner (to prepare for the weekend crowd maybe?), and there was a DJ on Thursday as well as a whole-pool football game. The pool definitely takes on more of a party atmosphere on the weekends. It was fun, unless you didn?? want to participate, in which case you could sit in the hot tub or risk getting knocked in the head with a ball. All in all, the small pool is definitely the drawback with TI, but it?? not all bad. If you just want to sit in the pool you can find space, but just don?? plan on swimming around unless maybe you get there at 8 am. The upside is they have plenty of lawn chairs for everyone. (My boyfriend and I wonder why all the hotel pools are closed at night? Night swimming would be great in Vegas!) Also, the drinks will bankrupt you at the pool at $9/18/23 for a S/M/L pina colada or margarita with hardly any liquor, but maybe that?? just Vegas standard.<br/><br/>Overall, TI is great and we would stay here again. If you haven?? stayed here yet, definitely give it a try. The staff is nice too. It does have a lot of kids around during the week but by Thursday the weekend crowd moves in and the families start to clear out. (Hey some people on here say it?? too family-oriented, and some people say it?? too party-oriented, it?? a mixed bag!) Even though my boyfriend and I are pool people, the other factors made up for the pool not being that great, and we still made the most of the pool area because it?? not horrible. The food is fantastic, and most of all you won?? find a nicer room for the price!	5	-1	-1	-1	5	4	-1	5

It was perfect through and through. The comments and negative rviews made around the resort fee, was not an issue for us. We knew about the resort fee and thefore accepted it and did not let it become a prblem or issue for our hliday. <br/><br/>We waited in a que for check in for approx 10 mins (wasnt a prob) and was upgraded to the top floor with panoramic windowds, which was incrediable. The check in lady was great and provided us with maps, 2:1 offers and other vouchers. <br/><br/>Our room was HUGE, incredible bed and good space. It was nice being able to see a view of the strip and also a view of the mountains and desert.<br/><br/>During our stay in Vegas we visited the old vegas town, which was well worth it and Phantom and Cirque De Solier were both a must do!<br/><br/>We also did the Grand Canon tour (grand adventures). It was over a 1`2 hour day but worth every penny and was breathtaking!<br/><br/>We also drove to LA for couple of days after which is again a surreal place. <br/><br/>Treasure Island food and casinos were great. The free drinks kept flowing and the staff were all very helpful.<br/><br/>Over all this hotel and this holiday would be well recommended! 4****<br/><br/>I will try to add some pics	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

Stayed at Treasure Island resort. The price received from Expedia was excellent! The rooms looked just like they were displayed on the website. However, what was most disconcerting was the cleanliness of the rooms. The bed linens were very dirty and one of the beds was broken. It took several sets of linens before we had some that were acceptable. I've also never been to a hotel were they didn't have bed skirts or linens to conceal the box spring. The trash can had not been emptied and the room did not have wash cloths. What a disappointment! I would not stay at the resort again because of the concern regarding the cleanliness of the rooms.	2	-1	-1	-1	2	2	-1	-1

Very attentive, quick check-in. We get a junior suite (because they have two bathrooms, very important for us!)... We called ahead because we stay and play a couple of times a year, and our past patronage earned us what I was told would be two comped nights in the room out of four nights we were staying (about a $260 value), $100 food credit at the restaurants, and $300 in free play. When we got to the hotel, imagine my surprise when the desk clerk said, &quot;So we're comping three nights...&quot; I tried to argue with him, but he insisted. And so I said, &quot;Well, who am I to argue with another free night??&quot; We had great gaming and eating experiences, including eating at the Italian Steakhouse with hubby's daughter, to the tune of $249. <br/><br/>When we checked out, I saw the bill and was further amazed. They had comped us all four nights of lodging, plus all we owed for the $249 dinner (which should have been $149 after the $100 credit) was $40. So they absolutely over-delivered in the comp department for us! The room was gorgeous and immaculate as usual. Oh, and the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on in a hotel.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

The hotel is very very basic, no frills and Im not very sure why it has a 4 star rating. We got it at a very good price and I didn't really have high expectations, so wasn't disappointed but do not be mislead by its rating, its not more than 2.5 to 3 stars. <br/><br/>We had actually booked it for 3 nights but stayed for only two as when we reached there we were told they were sold out for the night and would we would have to stay at trump and come back tomorrow, they had made arrangements for that. <br/><br/>To summarize the stay here are the positives and Negatives:<br/><br/>Negatives:<br/><br/>1) They didn't honor the booking: <br/>we were expected to arrive at Las Vegas at 12 am the night falling on 5th/6th Aug and I had given them a call that morning to confirm the booking ( I was rather glad it was late so that there will be no long queues that so much has been written about in the reviews). Our flight was late by 3 hours so we reached the hotel at 3 am. The girl at the front desk was polite but said they were sold out hence we would have to stay at TRUMP for the night. I wasn't happy about it, but was already dealing with a situation (I had lost my credit card at the airport so was on call with the customer care) so didn't say much about it. They also offered to reimburse the taxi receipts for our travel to and from TRUMP. She promised we would be able to checkin before noon as trump's checkout time was by 11 am.<br/>I called the next morning to confirm my room was ready, was put on hold and then told that I cannot check-in before 1 pm . Another 2-3 calls and I told them they are wasting, my time, another hold I was told I can come, my room will be ready. Reached the hotel around 11:15, already queues were there, but didn't have to wait long. The guy at the desk was polite and professional. Our room was ready, no hitches there. He also gave us a room with the view upon request.<br/><br/>2) The Room was ok, bathroom was clearly dated:<br/> The room was not very big, no coffee, microwwave, fridge or drinking water( really !! in a 4 star). The bathroom was clearly dated, the paint was coming off the wooden panels and all. The bath tub looked realllllllly old and this hotel was built in the 90s !!. Single sink had no stopper, strange to see the gaping hole there.<br/>However everything was neat and tidy.<br/><br/>3) No refrigerator and its mentioned in the list of amenities for the rooms:<br/> I called them and asked about it, they said not all rooms have it. However they did provide it upon request. It was brought to our room immediately on a huge plastic trolley :)<br/><br/>4) No drinking water:<br/> I have travelled a lot, and this was the first time I had to buy water all the time. Maybe this is a norm with the Vegas hotels not sure, but I found it very strange. There are ice vending machines though.<br/><br/><br/>Positives:<br/><br/>1) Location !! Location !! Location !!<br/><br/> Loved the location of the hotel. Its right in the middle of the activity, just as I wanted it. There is a huge mall ( Fashion Mall) right next to it. A walgreens right opposite and is connected to Mirage by a free tram.<br/><br/>2) The Staff:<br/> I found the staff overall professional , polite and quick. Except for the few calls I had to make when I was moving from the TRUMP, overall very helpful.<br/><br/>3) Cleanliness and sleep quality:<br/> The beds were very comfortable and clean. The room was also clean, I can't say it was spotless because overall everything looks so old and sort of worn out but I couldn't spot and dirt, dust of lack or attention both in the room and bathroom. The housekeeping people seem to do a decent job of whatever they have at hand.<br/><br/>To sum up, this will definately not be my 1st, 2nd or 3rd choice for my next trip to Vegas. I found Trump far far better. It was very modern and comfortable. The bathrooms were amazing there. The only thing is that its not in the middle of the action, had it been I would look no further for my next trip.	3	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	5

The rooms were beautiful, comfortable, and clean, the buffet was a good value, and the bar we visited was busy but the service was good. By chance we got a room facing the pirate show and on the night we went to bed early (11 or so) it was somewhat annoying to hear cannons going off while we were trying to go to sleep (it's Vegas, I know, but we were there for work!).<br/><br/>I was there for a convention at the Sands and while it's a hike it's really not a lot farther than staying at the Venetian, you just have to cross a street instead. I will absolutely stay there again!	4	-1	-1	-1	5	3	-1	4

I stayed there from a Friday-Monday and got a great price compared to other hotels. The room was very clean and nice. Other then that, TI doesn't have much else to offer compared to other hotels. The restaurants are mediocre, the pool is nice but nothing exciting and there are no clubs or shopping. Other then sleeping at TI we spent most of our time at other hotels going to beach clubs, nightclubs, shopping and restaurants. TI is nicely located on the strip to be able to walk to other hotels and there is a nice mall across the street from TI (some nice high end stores). Overall my experience at TI was ok, but if you are looking for better amenities and want to &quot;be in the mix&quot;, you might want to look at other hotels. The biggest draw is the price and the location in proximity to other hotels.	4	-1	-1	-1	5	3	-1	5

We spent $400 for 4 nights. You can't beat that. However, I found the staff to be rude -- it was missing the level of service you receive at a nicer hotel. The wait for check-in was ridiculous and we couldn't figure out why there weren't more people working at the counter. The pool scene Saturday afternoon is like an episode of Jersey Shore. I felt embarrassed for families there. The pool also smelled funny. The rest of the week, though, the pool was nice. The decor reminded me of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disney. The bed, however, was very comfortable. There are no coffee makers in the rooms -- I don't know if that's all of Vegas or just this hotel, but that bothered me. It certainly wasn't the best hotel on the strip -- but still a good value for the money.	5	-1	-1	-1	3	3	-1	5

However we did feel the hotel wasn't as clean as in the past. Also, the room needed some cosmetic maintainence. The beds were very comfortable, and the rooms are very quiet.

We went with several other couples and they wanted to stay at T.I. and we thought it wasn?? ??hat?bad so why not, but if we had to choose ourselves this would not be our first choice for a nice hotel in Vegas. The best thing about it is the location, right in the center of the strip. The rooms are fine nothing too spectacular about them but comfy beds etc. We rented a cabana one day and that is always a fun thing to do. Our cabana girl was super nice and very attentive to our large group. The pool is on the small side and as the day goes on it gets pretty crowded. We got a really good deal on our room rates but we booked about 6 months ahead of time. It does seem that T.I. often puts out deals on their rooms so you should be able to find a good rate, however whatever rate you do pay add $21.50 per day to that, as that is T.I.?? resort fee! I don?? even know what you get for that fee but that is what they charge you. If you??e looking for good, not great hotel, on the strip this is the place for you. But if you want a great hotel with much more in the way of special niceties there are many other ones along the strip and not for that much more money.	3	-1	-1	-1	4	3	-1	4

One day I was greeted by a panhanlder right inside the Casino asking for money to get his business restarted.<br/><br/>Overall this is an average property and is located on the far side of the strip.

Positive note: I didn't answer my wake up call and they sent a security guard to my door to make sure everything was ok. That was a first for me at any hotel.	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1

Nicely appointed rooms. Mid week room rates are fairly reasonable!<br/>There are two things that I found very disappointing.<br/>First that it took 45 min. the check in at the front desk. Something that I find totally unacceptable.<br/>Second, when we get to the hotel we find that they are charging a $22 RESORT FEE.<br/>I though only my bank charged me to use their facilities. This $22 included an outlandish charge for $14.95 for the use of the internet. In this day and age the cost for them is peanuts but they are increasing their profit with this charge with undisclosed fees when you book a reservation.<br/>Well so much for leaving tips for the hotel staff!!	2	-1	-1	-1	5	2	-1	4

The room was spacious and comfortable. Maid service was excellent. Being able to see the nightly Sirens/Pirate show from our hotel room was a real bonus. Of course we couldn't resist going down to see the show up close (we did 3 times). The price was a great value as we booked the room for under $100 a night. The various taxes and fees for the city of Las Vegas and State of Nevada bumped it up to $120 per night (still a good deal). The one downside was that breakfast was not a high priority at TI. I guess breakfast is not what people come to Las Vegas for anyway. Overall, we were very happy with our stay and would come back to Treasure Island.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

I booked about 2 months in advance and got some good pricing. For the price that I paid for room at that tine I felt the rooms were great. We had a corner room, which had a beautiful view. Housekeeping was friendly and room always looked great. I am going to vegas again in September and looked into Treasure Island again. The prices this time around I did not feel was worth it. We had no problem checking in and staff was friendly.	5	-1	-1	-1	4	5	-1	4

We chose this hotel because the shuttle to the small las vegas airport was offered from here. (We found out later that they will pick you up from any hotel) .The room was nice and a fair size with a view of the strip. The room was quiet but we were at the very end of the hall. We had to wait in line about 20 mintues to check-in in the afternoon. The employee that checked us in seemed indifferent but was courteous. <br/>The hotel was very crowded in the check-in area and the walk between the elevators and the lobby. We found many people rude by not moving over to make it easier for all to pass without bumping into one another. We tried to be polite and move over to one side but others would just barge through the middle bumping into whoever was in their way. <br/>The casino had a good varitiy of games.<br/>TI is a good location to walk the strip being next to the Mirage and across the street was a CVS and the Venitian. <br/>We ate breakfast on the poolside restuarant which was average. The portions were on the large size but the food wasn't all that great but it was filling and $7.99 with coupon received at check in. Service was good and the waitress was friendly. On our return to TI we ate at the Mexican restuarant for dinner which was good, but pricy for mexican food. Again, nothing impressive but not bad either. Service was OK even though the restuarant was practically empty. Drinks were expensive. The next morning we walked down the street a block to Denny's for a reasonably price breakfast and big portions. Service was OK but they were very busy, we had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. Food was good. <br/>We did encounter some nice, friendly employees at the TI. Twice we used the bell staff and they were always very nice. We left our luggage with them for a week while we did our whitewater rafting trip and it was promptly brought up to our room upon our request.	3	-1	-1	-1	4	3	-1	4

I guess I gambled a lot there on my last trip, because I was invited to stay free, with a food and slot credit. I expected a low floor with no great view for a comped room, but I was pleasantly surprised to get a high floor with a strip view. The room was their standard: nicely furnished, felt new, and clean. My only complaint was that the bathroom lacked a heat light timer, didn't have quality towels, and the shower curtain was cheap quality.<br/><br/>There was no wait to check in on the 'invited guest' line. All staff was exceptionally polite. Great buffet, Kanter's Deli is wonderful. The coffee shop for breakfast had poor service. We sat for 10 minutes and had to ask for service.<br/><br/>We enjoyed the pool and restaurant that had an area there.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	4	-1	5

I got the room on Priceline for a good deal. We got a room on the top floor with beautiful views of the strip and Vegas. The room was gorgeous. Nicely furnished and high ceilings. Plenty of space for a couple. The top floor requires key access. Not sure if we were in an upgraded room or if they are all this fancy. But we were very happy. The buffet was pretty good. I thought $20 for lunch was a little pricey. Yet everything seems very expensive in Vegas these days. The pizza place was decent yet the workers had zero personality. The downfall of TI , in my opinion and probably why I will never stay there again, is the pool. I am 38 and like to have a good time. But this pool is like the Real World hits Las Vegas. Starting at noon, the DJ starts. The music gets louder &amp; louder. The young adults cram the pool with drinks overflowing. The drunks start to make a scene. They scream and yell...and the music keeps thumping! One day I tried to take a rest in the afternoon in my room on the 36th floor. I could not sleep because the music from the pool was blasting so loud. The resort only has one pool so you have no other choice or place to relax by a quiet pool. The chairs fill up by 9am. There is zero shade by the pool unless you rent a cabana. On a Friday a woman said there was a 28 person waiting list for a cabana. In this day and age you would think hotels would provide some shade for patrons for free so we don't get skin cancer. Overall the hotel and casino is very nice...just beware if you want to have a peaceful day by the pool...it won't happen here!	4	-1	-1	-1	4	3	-1	4

I almost stayed at the LV Hilton again after vowing never to come back but at the last minute I switched since other coworkers were staying here.<br/><br/>Rooms - Clean, comfortable, 4 star quality, comfy pillows, nice marble bathroom, flat screen tv. Didn't book anything special but got 32nd floor with a strip view (if you look at the shape of the hotel you'll realize you have a statistically good chance of getting a strip view). Didnt have a lot of noise from other rooms but the treasure island show goes on with cannons and music until midnight. As a frequent hotel traveler I'd say the rooms are pretty unremarkable but what I would expect for 4 star. If you are looking for something amazing or romantic try Aria, Palm's Place, or Encore.<br/><br/>Casino - typical smokey vegas casino. reasonable table limits, wasn't really here for gambling<br/><br/>Checkin - every lane open, mile long line took about 10 minutes start to finish<br/>Checkout - the express checkout option didn't work so i had to stand in line.<br/><br/>Resort fee - regardless of how you book you will have the resort fee (so if you use priceline your price is not inclusive of that) it was 20 per day plus tax when i visited. As a leisure traveler i would never stay in an mgm resort for this reason, but as a business traveler it actually worked to my advantage because it includes internet and is a required fee so i wouldn't have to justify expensing internet separately. <br/><br/>Food - i ate the deli once, pretty tasty for a quick bite. didn't have a chance for any of the other restaurants.<br/><br/>location - out of the six visits this is the most central i've ever stayed on the strip and I was quite a fan of being that central. you can walk to everything, there is a walgreens directly across the street, and you can go across the street to harrahs if you need a free shuttle to rio.<br/><br/>One last thing worth noting, if you are doing personal travel or your business lets you use priceline, there are only 2 4 star hotels in the class of this area, and this is the cheaper one, so you are more or less guaranteed to get it in on priceline. I saved 40 bucks a night booking through priceline name your bid.	4	-1	-1	-1	4	5	-1	5

We've been to TI several times before, and I have to say, TI never changes. Same basic quick and efficient check in with an insignificant wait. Same for check out. Navigating the casino floor is always a challenge, and you can get lost easily if you stray from the main course. And if you stay on the main course, it is very, very crowded. Like almost all strip locations, you have to beware of the folks that decide to stop and stand there, oblivious to the fact that they are in a pedestrian thoroughfare. Oh, well. That's Vegas, these days, at least. Clean rooms, good service, and quiet, especially on the upper floors. Don't know how the noise level rates on the lower dozen floors. Good views of the strip if you're luck, or a good view of the fashion mall or the mountains if you're not. Mystere at Cirque du Soleil is a must. Probably one of the better shows on the strip. I forgot it was a circus for most of the show. Coffee shop is good for breakfast. Kahunaville is worth visiting once for the basic weirdness of the place. Got to see a hot shot bartender contest. I think it was 'open bar' night. So is the Deli. Their mexican restaurant (forgot the name) is good too. Unfortunately, everything at TI is overprices, including the gift shops. TI charges about 20-25 dollar a day resort fee. I don't know why. I don't have a clue what you get for it. I guess it's for internet. But these days, with pocket wireless devices, you don't really need that. But TI is consistent. You won't get hassled, you won't have any real problems. They will take care of you, if you need taking care of. A dependable place to stay.	4	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	4

Room was clean and comfy with nice view. Big thing for us was the machines played with us much better then higher end property. As been stated not high end,but more middle class which we are. If you can go to Canters' deli try ther Matzo Ball soup. For $5 you cant' finish it and I'm not a faith member!

I was prepared for a not so great room. I was pleasantly surprised. My room was spacious, but with a view of a brick wall. If I stood on tiptoe I could see the top of Trump Tower, but that was okay. There were no wash cloths in the room the first night; reduced to using a hand towel in the shower. The safe didn't work at all. But there was a functioning mini fridge, so that was a plus. The room was quiet and clean. The casino was very nice. All the machines were working and I walked away with an extra 30 bucks of gambling money. A short but pleasant visit. I would stay there again.	4	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	5

We had to make it a very quick trip due to childcare issues and were only staying one night. I had read the reviews and I knew there have been issues about long check-in waits. I would not have gone here based on those reviews, but our friends were all booked here. Never again! Check-in is your first impression of a hotel. We arrived at 11:45am. The line to check-in was 2 rows deep and they were not checking anyone in until noon. So we chose to wait. At about 12:05 one person came out and began to check-in the first couple in line. It took 20 minutes to do that and the line was not moving. Slowly a few more workers came out at about 12:15. We were finally checked in at 1pm. We also witnessed a guy cut in line and they did nothing about it. Our friends chose to check-in later and headed out to the pool. When they came to check-in at 4, it also took them an hour. We have all agreed that we will never stay here again. It is unacceptable. No one should ever be treated this way. I have stayed in Vegas over 50 times and have never had this experience. And since this issue has come up over and over again in several reviews, it is obvious the hotel chooses not to fix this problem. Hotel gets 2 stars for the location.	2	-1	-1	-1	3	1	-1	3

It had been nearly five years since I stayed there last, and it certainly has aged well. Having lived and worked in Vegas, I know the hotels well, and TI is doing a great job.<br/><br/>THE GOOD:<br/>Rooms - fantastic. Fresh and clean, some of the best beds of any hotel I have visited. Very quiet, and the blackout drapes definitely help.<br/><br/>Staff - great people. From the front desk to the bar staff, everyone was great.<br/><br/>Internet - nice and fast.<br/><br/>THE SO-SO:<br/>The pool is 'just OK.' There was an incredibly annoying DJ trying to make it a party for the three twenty somethings there on a Friday afternoon. Waitress service is slow, but the poolside bar is quick &amp; friendly. The $23 drinks are a tad on the ridiculous side, though...<br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/>The resort fee is ridiculous. I know it has become the trend in Vegas, but $20/day for internet access, an ill-equipped gym, and the ability to print a boarding pass is asinine. <br/><br/>The buffet was pretty mediocre. We went for brunch on Saturday, and, at $25, it was well overpriced - even with free champagne!<br/><br/>Net, the place is still a good value. The room was one of the lowest priced on the strip, and it was pretty great. Net, I would return again and recommend.	4	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

I went there to celebrate my cousin's 21st birthday because they offered the best rates for the 16 room block that we booked. I am normally an easy rater but I have to give TI an average because it took about an hour and a half to check-in. It was ridiculous, it seemed like every receptionist was getting trained. I have never waited so long and we arrived at 10:30 pm, on a Friday. I had also requested a non-smoking two bed room, but had to settle for a smoking two bed room. OMG! It was disgusting I could not sleep, it smelled like an ashtray in the room, I did not even feel comfortable using the towels because of their horrible odor. To their defense the next day I called and they switched my room to a non-smoking two bedroom. The Cafe their was awesome and the buffet was decent, I would definitely go back to both of them. I mean I am not running back, but I would go back. The Casino atmosphere was cool and I did win at the Casino, so that was awesome. However the Hotel needs help as far as the rooms and especially checking you in. I passed by again on Saturday night because the lobby was on the way out to Valet and the line to check-in seemed longer.	3	-1	-1	-1	2	2	-1	4

We initially had a lot of difficulty getting confirmation of our reservation from the online booking staff, but once we arrived at the hotel everything was great. Our room was large, overlooked the pool and the strip and had the most comfortable, largest bed I have stayed in. The place is massive, on scale we don't get in the UK, but everything worked pretty well. The buffet was very good, we enjoyed the pool and had a good, fun night out at Gilley's. If I came back to Vegas I wouldn't hesitate to stay at TI again, with it's excellent location, free parking just off the Interstate and that bed, man I can feel myself drifting off just thinking about it.....	4	-1	-1	-1	4	3	-1	5

The hotel itself is ideally located in the middle of &quot;the strip&quot; with some nice features. We got in late and our room type was not available so they &quot;upgraded&quot; us to a suite for the night. The one night upgrade was a mixed bag. The layout of the room was spacious and the amenities were excellent. Unfortunately, it was not very clean. There were (thick) finger prints all over the mirrors, sunflower seeds on the floor throughout with candy wrappers too. The bed was unbelievably comfortable (and clean). We had our young child (who could not be left home) so we requested a crib. To our amazement, they brought us a pack 'n play without the bottom piece that makes it safe for a child to sleep on, only an extra thick blanket for padding, which any parent knows is unsafe and potentially deadly. We pointed this out and were given a proper mattress that fit.<br/><br/>The next day we took abbreviated showers as the drain clogged quickly (less then 5 minutes total showering). Fortunately, breakfast was great at Kahunaville and switched to the correct room. Funny thing, the room should have been a step down from the suite, but it was actually better! It was clean, comfortable, and well put together. The shower did not clog either! Nice corner room with a view of the Sirens show that is based in the front of the property on the strip. It was also very quiet. We did not hear any of our neighbors. We did hear the fireworks that went off every night right outside our window as part of the nightly shows, but were surprised that they weren't louder than than the were.<br/><br/>The Bell Service was knowledgeable and help set up a tour the Hoover Dam that was inline with pricing with most other options.<br/><br/>The pool area was fun, good loud music and good size bar (no swim-up bar unfortunately). The only issue here was it reeked of sulfur. This maybe related to coming down at 6pm after a day of hard partying in the pool by other guests so maybe this was just a case of bad timing.<br/><br/>Prior to the wedding, we purchased services from the onsite spa (Oleksandra). I checked out the attached gym and it was impressive considering you don't expect to workout much in Vegas, but it had everything you needed, plenty of it and was impeccably clean. The staff were friendly and did a great job, except that some of the pampering did not hold up for long as expected. When I brought this up, I was told that we would get a call from the on-duty manager or her boss by the end of the day to work something out, but never heard from them. That's a significant failure in customer service.<br/><br/>Overall, there were some great things about this hotel and some not so great. Overall, I'd stay here again, mostly for the location.	3	-1	-1	-1	3	3	-1	3

Checked the bags, got a ticket, went exploring Las Vegas! Eventually checked in at around five o clock and the lady helping us was very polite and efficient. Checkin took about 2 mins! Be sure to check your floor number, TI has seperate elevators for the different floors and not all elevators reach all floors. Takes a bit of getting used to!<br/><br/>The rooms are great, we got a strip view room and it was such an upgrade from the Hilton I was very happy. The room has a fridge and an electronic safe in the very well designed cupboards. Additionally a iron and hair dryer was also provided that really worked well when the need arose to use it. Bathrooms are nice and spacious and everything is well maintained. The previous guests did not leave the safe unlocked and when I phoned security to come assist me with the problem they arrived nearly at the same time as me placing the phone back on the receiver! Quickly assessed the problem, gave me the paperwork to sign and unlocked the safe for me. I was most impressed with the professional conduct of the security personell overall.<br/><br/>All in all, we really enjoyed our stay. TI might be a bit older than most of the other casino's in Vegas but they definitly also have a lot of good experience making it a memorable place to stay in!	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

It wasn't until after booking the trip that I learned about the latest hotel SCAM -- the old &quot;Bait and Switch&quot; -- we charge less for our rooms than other resorts, but REQUIRE you to pay $22.40 per day for services that you're not going to use (internet access, a newspaper, use of the telephone in the room, use of the gym). Gee folks, like I came to Vegas to browse the internet, read the newspaper or workout in the gym.<br/><br/>After about a 30 minute battle with the manager over this UNETHICAL business practice, I finally swipe my card then look the manager in the eye and said: &quot;Please tell executive management to invest this absurd --resort fee-- very carefully...it's the last red cent your outfit will get from me or anyone I speak with.&quot; The manager right then and there waived the resort fee for the duration of our stay.<br/><br/>Seriously folks, it's time to stand up to this abuse. I could have just as easily booked my stay at Ceasars Palace, Bally's, The Rio or a number of other resorts and would have not been subjected to this absurd &quot;resort fee&quot; nonsense.	3	-1	-1	-1	4	3	-1	4

The only thing about the room was the extra fee per day for things we didn't use, like internet, phone, gym and spa or pool. Approx. $22.00 more a day. All meals we ate at TI, were from $30. to $40 for two. We did enjoy the deli food very much.. The casino had a good variety of keno machines, which we prefer, and also live gaming keno. However, Live gaming keno closed each night we were there, at 11 pm until 8 am in the morning. The restrooms were plentiful and well placed around the casino, also very clean. Most casinos tend to favor the young, but it would be nice to have a dance area and music for us old folks who still like to dance and have a few drinks. Gilleys needs a senior citizen night for dancing, would be nice. My friend and I are hoping we can make another trip this year to Las Vegas, and we do like Treasure Island very much. Next time we will split our meals, because we were never able to finish all the food, delicious food, I might add. We highly recommend Treasure Island.	3	-1	-1	-1	4	5	-1	4

Its very affordable, it is located within the main area of the strip! Staff were friendly, the room was lovely and new. There was a long line at check in time but i think that seems to be a trend across vegas hotels during the peak check in times. The price was really fantastic for the quality of the rooms. The beds were soft and beautiful to sleep in. There is no mini bar in the room, that is the only thing i would change.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

We really enjoyed the hotel except that we thought they needed an adult only pool and put the kids in another pool area. It was hard to enjoy the pool and relax with kids running everywhere. We stayed on the 32nd floor and had a terrific view with a nice clean room, Check-in was a little slow and I thought that they could use some extra staff there. Ate at Gilley's twice and really enjoyed it, especially the bar and karokee contest. The resort fees really were my only complaint. I think it should be optional if you want to use the gym or internet you pay for it, if not then the resort fee should be waived. I would stay again but would like to be able to hang on to my money and not pay for things I am not using in paying resort fees.	4	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	4

Really no complaints except for the check in time. We got there at noon on Monday and it took about an hour to check in. The rooms were really nice and the bed was extremely comfortable. Individual thermostats in each room so you can adjust the temperature to your comfort level and its not one of those motion activated thermostats, hate those. The staff was very nice and accomodating. The casino is very clean and Mystere was a wonderful show, worth every penny. Watch out for the resort fee, we knew about it in advance, but $20 + tax is kind of a rip and should just be included in the room rate since it is not optional and it really doesn't add much value to most peoples stay, but you can make it up with the 2 for 1 lunch buffet you get with it. We would definitely recommend staying there to our friends and will be coming back again on our next trip.	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1

I stayed here about 15 years when it just opened. I was a bit skeptical about staying here again because of the reviews. But this place was awesome. We checked it about 2pm on a friday. It was about 30 minute wait. The front desk was friendly. At the front desk, you can see the pool area which was pretty crowded. We were on the 15th floor and far from the elevators which I asked for. We had the view of the mall which was fine. The beds were so comfy. Loved the pillows. The room was kinda small compared to others. But the beds were so worth it. <br/>The casino was always busy which is always a good sign. All of the staff were pretty friendly. The pool was a little small. The pool area consisted of a small bar, one medium sized pool and one jacuzzi. I visited the pool at about 3pm to check out the atmosphere. There were plenty of adults. I have 2 kids so I wanted to take them swimming. But at the time, I felt it wasnt approriate and the pools were crowded.<br/>We went back to the pool at about 0830 and it was not crowded at all. My 5 year old son loved it. There were plenty of lounge chairs available. I wanted to try the ti buffet but didnt have a chance. I did try Canters a deli. omg!! delicious! I dont remember the sandwich but it was oh so good. They had a good variety of casino games and had keno. I was very happy with ti and I would definetly stay here again.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	4	-1	5

We were there 3 years ago after our wedding (also in August) and had a wonderful experience (when Treasure Island was still a part of MGM/Mirage). This trip was to celebrate our anniversary, my birthday, and also in town for a little business but mostly just vacationing.<br/><br/>We booked this trip several months ago, and had reserved the Tower Suite, it was the highest available room to book so we got it, and had stayed in a Tower Suite 3 years ago so it was going to be great. However, upon check-in, the room we booked wasn't available until the day after. That wasn't a big deal since we were going to be staying for five nights. We were willing to pay more for a higher room but it wasn't available (to us anyways), I guess we weren't VIP enough so we settled for a lesser room for the first night. The next day we finally got into a smoking, Tower Suite and it smelled and looked cleaner than the non-smoking room we got the night prior which smelled like huge amounts of pot and not as cleaned up as expected. Like I said before, my wife and I had expectations because we were there before but this time it was the little things that made it less enjoyable. <br/><br/>The $20 + tax a day is a joke as been stated by others before, it should just be in the room cost since it is required. $100 a day hold on a credit card for booking a suite (not in the fine prints that I read when booking or on the confirmation letter). We thought there was a refrigerator in the room under the TV, but the maintenance guy said it's a cooler (plugged into an outlet) so they wheeled a mini-fridge to our room. Two days later, the cooler had cooled our hot water (we forgot to put into the fridge) down to cold water, which I didn't know that's how coolers worked. The TV was surprisingly small, definitely smaller than the one in the room on the first night. <br/><br/>I am usually someone that looks at the bigger picture, and yes bigger picture we had an alright time, it is Las Vegas afterall. However, the little things with our room situations did not give us the confidence of staying at &quot;TI&quot; in the future. For being deemed a &quot;suite,&quot; and being the highest available for public purchase, it did not even live up to a room at the Embassy Suites. Tables not cleaned prior to our check-in, cracks in the bathroom, door apparently missing in front of the cooler/slow fridge...etc.<br/><br/>We are going back to Vegas in February 2012 and have talked some of our friends to join us, but in all honesty we are going to book with MGM/Mirage hotels, Venetian, or Wynn because we have heard great things about them.	3	-1	-1	-1	3	3	-1	4

However it is cheap and the location is great so I might very well stay there again. See if the MYTI discount code works. I got 40% off with that.<br/>They downgraded the suit I booked to a standard room on check-in (which took an hour and a half) but put us in our suite for the rest of our stay. I have to say they were pretty rude about the downgrade. Take it or leave it sort of thing. And given the amount and variety of comps they have to hand, the $50 food/drink voucher really didn't cut the mustard.<br/>if you like a firm bed avoid the duvet-top mattress as it is very very soft. Uncomfortably so.<br/>There is a good variety of bars and restaurants in the hotel. Gillies is fun. There's a country and western theme with karaoke and bull riding. The steak house is okay but bad value for money. The buffet is good but there are better options on the strip. The Wynn buffet is great for breakfast and lunch but the dinner buffet at the Cosmopolitan has to be tried to be believed. It's amazing!	4	-1	-1	-1	4	2	-1	2

In my opinion this is the only resort where you get your moneys worth, its affordable yet beautiful and clean and located in the heart of Vegas. It is right across the street from the Fashion Show Mall, next to Wynn, Encore and Venetian. It has a great show (sirens of Caribbean) every night at 7 30 and 9 for FREE!!!! It is clean and the rooms are modern and beautiful. They have great promotions and deals. I love it and so does my family. We go to vegas 4-5 times a year because it is a 4 hour drive, and we decided to only book TI, we have stayed at many different hotels (MGM, Mandalay Bay, Palazzo) and we love this one because its cozy and not huge where you cant find your way out, but it has allll the ammenities you may need.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

What a big mistake this was! What was meant to be a relaxing time away in a pleasant comfortable hotel felt more like a shabby motel from a budget movie.<br/><br/> If it wasn't the appalling maid service which was at fault it was the rude and impolite manor of the staff especially the bell desk service. Beginning with the Maid Service I have no idea why they were so adamant to access our room everyday as servicing it adequately was far from their agenda. <br/><br/>After a long and tiring journey coupled with jet lag me and my partner were enjoying a afternoon nap safeguarded with privacy please sign hanging on our room door only to be disturbed by the sharp telephone ringing: 'housekeeping wish to clean your room.' As if this wasn't enough the room was cleaned in a very 'slap-dash' manor, we were given pillow cases that were too small meaning half the pillow hung out and was uncovered, the pillow itself showed many unidentified stains. After ringing and complaining that it was unhygienic and unacceptable we were given larger pillow cases yet still too small for the pillows. At this point we gave up and took to sleeping on the second borrowers-sized scatter cushion that they gave us when we asked for extra pillows. At the end of our stay we ended up with an array of tiny misshapen pillows with ill fitting pillowcases-i now understood why on check-in I saw a man equipped with his own pillow strapped to his luggage(wise man).<br/><br/>The sheets and bed linens were not changed an appropriate amount of times for our lengthy stay and also the bathroom towels were worn and in need of replacing. The only thing the maid service did well in our rooms was polish the services and top up the complimentary toiletries -pity the same generousity and cleanliness wasn't shown with the bed. The hallway on our floor was in bad need of vacuuming; the same choice spillages remaining for days. <br/><br/>Now on to the shoddy bell desk, the members of staff who provided this incomplete service were extremely rude,. If you want to pay for every eventuality and for somebody to simply breath make full use of this service. On check out we tipped the bell person appropriately for collecting our luggage from our room and taking it down to the hold. However, arriving later at the luggage store to the left of the lobby we were greeted with 2 miserable rude bell people. After they huffed and puffed about which one of them was going to serve us, one of them snatched the ticket off my partner stormed to the hold and carted our luggage 2 feet and just stood there, we took our own luggage off the trolley and loaded it ourselves into the back of the taxi yet amazingly this miserable impolite rude excuse for a bellboy expected a tip putting his hand out gesturing becoming angry and yelling at us and the taxi in front of other passing guests and staff members. I will be following this complaint up with the hotel via email/telephone call as we were disgusted-what a 'great' way to end a 2 week stay with the hotel. The bell desk will succeed single handedly in driving away all remaining Treasure Island customers before they even enter the hotel with an attitude like that. There was one man who actually was about to check in to the hotel but saw the commotion and actually decided to stay elsewhere.<br/><br/>The food in the TI buffet was nice enough and generally a good deal however stay clear of the Francesco's pizza if you wish for a take-out . It is ridiculously priced for the average pizza you get and there are a couple of very rude hot-headed chefs at the front. It is well worth taking the free tram ride from TI to California Pizza Kitchen within Mirage as they are far superior for the money you pay and nicer staff. <br/><br/>Please bear in mind voicing all of your complaints to reception tsaff upon check out will be difficult as they do not even ask how your stay was and when you do complain they do not want to know and generally do not care.<br/><br/>If you want rude incompetent staff with no manners but with a disgusting attitude. shoddy services, tipping on top of tips for a incomplete service than stay in Treasure Island. Also you may enjoy the 'Girls gone bad, a couple of choice country songs and various others on repeat with a overly excited DJ trying to get laid! This is in keeping with the overplayed 5 times played 'Pirate' show now a strip show titled 'Sirens.' The only thing pirate like about this show is the ship. If I heard the whaling sound 'ooooo arrrr oooo' one more time from the tram, outside the hotel, in the hotel or in my strip facing room I was about to go stir crazy. <br/><br/>p.s. If a man that goes by the name of Mike Kelly approaches you outside of the hotel after several 'Girls,girls girls' clickers and 'nightclub passes' scams do not go for his 'tour' of his hotel that he fails to name with a coffee maker, 100dollars slot play...do not fall for this as it is a scam! Similarly to TI he likes to rip people off!	1	-1	-1	-1	1	1	-1	2

One reason was the location-I like that the Walgreen's was right across the street as it was cheaper to buy pop, water and snacks over there than the gift shop in the hotel. My mom and I got there really early-8:30am and our room was ready to check in-a big plus. I also really liked the pool and the staff around the pool. It was not really busy our first day there so one of the waitresses sat and talked to my mom for awhile. Very friendly! I thought the rooms were decent, clean and beds comfortable. The only things I didn't care for was the food and resort fees. We tried the Deli (greasy greasy greasy) the buffet and the coffee shop. Nothing too fabulous. I preferred the restaurants at the Monte Carlo-better food for a better price. As several others have mentioned, not a fan of the $20 a day resort fee. Also, not a fan of the $100 a day credit card hold; that was not a requirement when I went in March, but I called the other day because we are talking about going at the end of September and was told about it. What is the deal with that?	4	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	4

I wish they would go smokeless but well its Vegas, and that may take years. Also on the con side, I notice their restaurant prices are creeping up.

I had stayed here in December 2010 with my wife. On this trip with the family, I was looking for a place to stay 2 nights that would provide some of the nice elements of the strip (convenience to nice restaurants, shopping, etc.) that was affordable and had a nice pool. When I stayed in December, the pool was closed and I never even looked at its size. I was concerned about some reviews that it was small. By Vegas standards, the pool might be small in comparison to other mega-hotels like Mirage, Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, but it was the perfect size for my kids (ages 12 and 9). It allowed my wife and I to keep an eye on them. I heard from others it was packed mid-day, but we used it at 8:00 AM when it opened for an hour or so and again at 6:00 PM until close at 8:00 PM (both nights) and it was great. The first night, there was a putrid smell, which we think was from the water misters (it was bad - everyone noticed it). The next night, the smell was gone. If it smelled like this all the time, people would be ticked. I was relieved that the second night it was gone. The pool grounds are nice, there is poolside service from waitresses, and a bar if you want to get the drinks yourself. <br/><br/>The room was spacious (bigger than the neighboring Mirage) and clean. Also quite quiet at night.<br/><br/>Had a sandwich from Canter's Deli which was great, but otherwise did not dine in the hotel restaurants (did grab a beer at Gilley's which was fun).<br/><br/>My only negative was that the VIP viewing at the Sirens Show is now back past the rest of the viewing - so instead of a preferred view, you get bad views behind everyone else, but it is reserved so there is room. Also checkin line 35 minutes which was too long to stand around, but par for any Vegas hotel depending on the time. In December, we checked in at almost exactly the same time and had no wait at all at this hotel.<br/><br/>Overall, for $69, you cannot go wrong. I considered Palazzo and Bellagio, but each were $175ish.	5	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	5

It's a nice mix of a classy hotel, but also offers fun night life, great proximity to the Mall (next door) and fine dining at a reasonable price within the hotel. Entertainment at the hotel is always top notch. Saw Comedian Sinbad perform last time I was there. I found out (too late) that Bill Cosby was due to perform on the day I was departing the hotel. Staff at this hotel are always friendly, polite and very helpful. I had driven about 9 hours and was quite tired upon checking in. Check in was quick and pleasant. My room was phenomenal. I was upgraded to a strip view room by the polite front desk man (who was also a native of Wisconsin.) The hotel provided me with 2 free passes to the buffet and the fitness/spa which I didn't have time to use on this trip. I look forward to a return to TI to stay a bit longer and enjoy the place.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

The suites need to be updated, the hotel room I wouldn't say was spot cleaned, there was dirt in the grime of the tile, it has 70's style red Marble and couch. The hotel room wasn't bad, it just didn't meet expectations, the next time we will pay the extra money to stay elsewhere. Secondly, we tried to have breakfast at their restaurant, &quot;The Coffee Shop&quot;, It took 25 minutes to get the waitress to come over and attempt to take our order, at that point we had decided we would just go have lunch, I explained to the waitress, we were just going to drink the coffee and read the paper, we would appreciate our check. She came back 20 minutes later with our check. My husband handed his Visa to her and said here ya go, you can take it now (because we knew that it would be another 20 mins), she told my husband No and took another 10 mins to bring our check, needless to say she didn't get a tip. Part of the reason we signed up for Treasure Island was because expedia was doing a deal online for dinner for two with one night stay. When we checked in they didn't give us our free dinner, I asked the clerk, and they said well usually we don't do this if you stay less than two nights, but gave them to us anyways.	3	-1	-1	-1	2	1	-1	4

Check in was fine, got a Tower Suite room that was wheelchair accessable. We stayed last year too and our Tower Suite was bigger. We did end up changing rooms to the original Tower Suite. Had a few snags with the first room and customer service was great. Jess and Megan were so pleasant and helpful. Our stay was nice, room always was clean. TI is a good location and a good time. I do see some updates needed in the future to keep up with the other hotels. We do like the Tower Suite because of the 2 bathrooms, makes it so nice. So even with snags it helped so much that customer service was great.	4	-1	-1	-1	4	5	-1	4

We placed our bags in the holding area and toured the casino. When we came back to check in we were in line for about 1 hour. We had a 2 for 1 buffet coupon, so had lunch. Nothing special, not much for healthy choices. Had breakfast at the buffet one morning and for 3 of us it was over $70 - again nothing special on the buffet, very over priced. Tried the kahuuna for breakfast, it was very good and price was good. <br/>Room was quiet, very clean, bed was comfortable.<br/>Couldn't cool off in the pool as the water was too hot. Pool lounge chairs need a good cleaning. <br/>Staff were all very friendly and helpful. Although not enough waitresses in the casino area. Gilley's bar was a fun time.<br/>Watched the pirate show, good entertainment, kids like it.	-1	-1	-1	-1	5	3	-1	5

I didnt like the fact that i had to pay resort fee for a pool that wasnt even clean. Every day the maids kept coming into our room, even with the do not disturb sign.

We made this trip for my birthday and told the front desk and they sent up a bottle of champagne and upgraded our room for us. Yes, the check in is long and probably took about 30 minutes which was on a Monday around 2:30pm. I really liked how close it was to the mall and other hotels. We only ventured down the strip once because we didn't see the need to leave our area. They give you coupons at check in and we used all of them. There is a resort fee and it is high but you get free internet and the coupons make it worth it. We'll be back.	4	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	4

It is huge, impersonal but centrally located &amp; reasonably priced. We had a Strip view room which was worth the extra money. I booked it thinking it was aimed at families but I would say most guests are Twenty somethings with not many families in evidence. There is nothing to particularly interest children. The free &quot;Sirens Pirate Show&quot; is not very interesting &amp; is held on the street outside. The pool is quite nice but has music blaring all day long with occasional DJ slots, quite irritating after a while.<br/><br/>The rooms are small by American standards, fairly clean but with substantial luxurious marble bathrooms. The buffet breakfast/lunch are excellent. The gym is ok. We didn't pay the extra money to visit the spa. Like many central Strip rooms, TI charges $20 + tax daily resort fee/room, which is something of a rip off. All you really get is free in-room wireless internet &amp; vouchers for a 2 for 1 cocktail &amp; buffet lunch (one person only).<br/><br/>The check-in &amp; check-out queues are ridiculous, but at least one can check out in the room or online. We saw people queueing for an hour to check-in most afternoons. I've never seen this anywhere else in the world. The hotel was generally extremely crowded &amp; has the feel of an airport lounge.<br/><br/>Overall the price is reasonable but I would not go there again.	3	-1	-1	-1	4	2	-1	4
UR117158091	E64CA28FACBEA516413558C6D59F172F	Treasure Island - TI Hotel & Casino	Las_Vegas_Nevada	2011-08-23	We enjoyed our stay - Great Value	4	9	We just returned from a 3- night weekend staying at TI. We got a FANTASTIC deal and so I bore that in mind in terms of my expectations. We are in our 30's and Ihave been to Vegas a few times in the past few years and have stayed at Paris, Mirage and Wynn, which we all enjoyed. I knew going in that TI was not up to the level as Wynn or some of the other hotels, but we didn't want to spend as much on the hotel this time as hey, we're in Vegas.... who wants to hang out in your hotel room?<br/><br/>That being said, I read a lot of the reviews on here and got a little nervous as the trip approached, even thinking of changing our hotel last-minute (but that would have been $200-400 more per person to even stay somewhere as mid-range as Planet Hollywood). So we braced ourselves for the worst and were.....<br/><br/>Pleasantly surprised! It was a great experience overall.<br/><br/>Here are my positives:<br/>I really liked the size and manageability of TI-- it feels like a hotel, not a huge mall or massive complex and was easy and quick to navigate. Our room was certainly not as large as other hotels, but very nice and modern, and we had no issues at all with housekeeping--- the room and bathroom was spotless. We paid $10/each extra when booking the trip for a stripview and had a fantastic view of the strip- well worth it. Best part was the bed--- it was so comfortable, that I literally had the 3 soundest sleeps that I've had in years (could have been the late nights, but...). Our check-in and check-out were a breeze and we had nice staff on both occasions. Great location--- across from Palazzo and Venetian, beside Mirage (then Caesar's). We ate at the Coffee Shop when we arrived late Friday night (starving and desperate) and had a great, huge club sandwich for a good price. Gilley's is an absolute hoot--- I nearly busted a gut laughing at the attempts to ride the mechanical bull. I found the hotel refreshingly unpretentious and fun.<br/><br/>The Negatives:<br/>I knew in advance about the resort fees and so was not shocked or surprised by them. Yes, they're stupid and a cash-grab, but even with that, our trip was so reasonable that it still made tons of sense to stay there. Just be aware in advance and factor it into your entire deal. Also, the pool is not exactly spectacular, but it was lively and people seemed to be having a great time--- it was kind of refreshing to be at a less flashy hotel and see people from all age groups and walks of life just having a ball. The buffet is not great--- I wouldn't bother with it--- Mirage and Wynn buffets are both amazing and so close (we usually hit a buffet for lunch/brunch, then splurge on late dinner).<br/><br/>Other than that, we loved our stay here. If you want glitz and glamour, then I highly recommend Wynn, Venetian, Palazzo, Bellagio or Cosmopolitan. But, if you see a great deal for Treasure Island- go for it! You'll get a nice room, smaller hotel in a great location, and have more $ left over for great restaurants and gambling.<br/><br/>I think TI is a great choice for people who are returning to Vegas after staying at some of the higher-end hotels.... if it's your first time there, you'll be so blown away by the other hotels, that TI will look shabby in comparison. If you're returning for the umpteenth time, like us, you realize that the hotel doesn't have much bearing on your overall time there and you want to go for a quick weekend to try some new restaurants and have fun, then it's perfect. <br/><br/>Even though I loved the Wynn as a physical hotel, I don't think I'd ever stay there again (felt just too far down the strip, crowd was kind of faux-riche wanna-be hotshots). Whereas, I would actually consider staying at TI again if the deal was right. I like to try a different hotel each time we go, but it's saying something about the hotel that this was my most fun Vegas trip yet. It's all about reasonable expectations and not sweating the small stuff--- you can let those imperfect details ruin your vacation, or just laugh them off and keep enjoying yourself.<br/><br/>It's pretty hilarious reading reviews sometimes and how minor incidents (a stray hair missed by housekeeping, or random rude staff who may be having a bad moment) can literally DERAIL some peoples' vacations and turn it into a downward spiral... lighten up people! If you return all those moments with a big smile and let it roll off your back, your vacay will be on track in no time. If you let it turn you into a ball of fury and frustration, well, more crap is going to come your way.<br/><br/><br/>Other random Vegas Notes: we ate at STK in Cosmopolitan one night and SushiSamba in Palazzo the other--- both FUN and great food. The Cosmopolitan is amazing and has incredible energy. Do I care if I actually sleep there for $800 more per couple? Not me. But, hey, if you've got the money, then by all means, you'll have a fantastic stay at a 5-star instead. Bill's Gambling Hall and Flamingo are fun to gamble in and Bill's has HILARIOUS karaoke on sunday nights. I find it's good to throw in some low-brow fun with the glitzy stuff.	5	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	5

Checked in at around 7:30pm and waited over 45 minutes in the smoky lobby. When I asked for directions to the hotel my conference was located at the staff was less than helpful. <br/><br/>When I finally made it up to my room I was pleasantly surprised. The furnishings looked quite modern and nice, and I got the king sized room I requested. Upon closer inspection the room left a LOT to be desired. On the first night I discovered a crusty stain on the sheets, which obviously had not been changed. After requesting for a bed linen change, the new linens had several dark stains on them. Gross! Towels were always &quot;crunchy&quot; - in definite need of replacement. Floors had obviously not been vacuumed in awhile and there were also suspicious white stains on the wallpaper. <br/><br/>Hotel restaurants did not look appetizing. I went for happy hour at the TI's highly rated &quot;Isla&quot; restaurant, and while the drink was delicious their food was sub-par (they use liquid cheese on their nachos). Most of the time I ended up taking the tram to the Mirage next door for decent eats. <br/><br/>Overall, the bargain price could not compensate for the lack of cleanliness. Next time I will definitely stay elsewhere.	3	-1	-1	-1	1	2	-1	4

While it's been around for awhile, it was very current, clean, and hip. The room was a comfortable size and the bed was heavenly. <br/><br/>We also appreciated that TI was not the monstrocity that some of the Vegas properties have become. It was big enough to have what we needed (pool, gym, Starbucks, bars, entertainment, etc.) but not so big that it took 30 minutes to go from one place to the next.

Be prepared to wait in lines longer than Disney. Our rooms were nice and clean had a great view. I agree with another post about the pool DJ, you can see along the music coming into your room in the morning. Casino area was fair. Take a walk to nearby casinos that are definately showier. The rewards card that they give you is worthless to use as the rewards are only available to those spending alot. Our family was there for 4 days and budgeted about 500 to 600 a day for gambling. When we were done we spent most of this at other casinos.<br/>Don't hold your breath for one of those great Vegas buffets here. Old Country Buffet serves a better menu at a cheaper price.

VERY clean, nice sized casino, it was never hard to get a chair by the pool (of course it was 105 most days, so that might have been why). Easy to get to the Mirage which also has a nice casino and great restaurants, and easy access to both the Fashion Show Mall and the shopping at the Venetian and the Palazzo. <br/><br/>Expensive of course, but that's to be expected. Two criticisms...don't eat at Kahunaville. The food was really just not tasty. Also, the fitness center is quite sauna-like. I'm in the midst of training for a half marathon, but it was impossible to do more than 2 miles on the treadmill without feeling like I was dying. A little AC would go a long way.<br/><br/>Other than that, it was great - the dealers are all nice in the poker room, and definitely recommend both the buffet and the pizza place.<br/><br/>We had a petite suite, which had two bathrooms - one with a shower and one with a whirlpool tub. We made fun of it at first, but it was kinda nice to have two bathrooms.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

The website says that refrigerators were on the way and our room did not have one yet. The pool was small, but nice. The buffet (they give you a 2-for-1 coupon) was well worth the money.

If this place really is a 4-star hotel, then the Wynn should be a 7 star or better.<br/><br/>Checking in at TI is an experience. As others have said, lines are longer than Disneyland. Check in time on a Thursday afternoon was about 45 minutes of standing. <br/><br/>The first thing I noticed was how dingy and dirty the rope line itself was. The brass holders had not been polished in weeks, maybe months. At the Wynn, someone is always running around cleaning everything in sight.<br/><br/>We got a room on the 33rd floor but it was right above the pirate show, and the noise was deafening during all of the shows. Very annoying and impossible to sleep until the last show is over. Obviously they skimped on money for soundproof windows.<br/><br/>The room itself was very small. It felt like a matchbook. The bed was nice though and the bathroom has nice marble tile, complimented by cheap K-mart towels and wash clothes.<br/><br/>One of the most annoying things is being forced to pay a mandatory $20 resort fee. Everyone is doing it but it seems like more of a ripoff at TI for some reason.	3	-1	-1	-1	2	-1	-1	3

Price being only $49/night, I couldn't go wrong.<br/>I'm not a gambler so I can't really comment about the casino. I spent $20 over 4 days and lost it, so I think I got off a lot better than most.<br/>The pool was extremely over-crowded and by 10AM it was almost impossible to find 4 chairs together. Having brought our kids it was frustrating not being able to sit together. Also, the chairs are pushed right up against each other leaving no room to walk between the chairs. I didn't like that I had to crawl up and down my chair everytime I wanted to get up. However it was a fun atmosphere and the pool was great despite the crowd.<br/>The line up for the buffet was ridiculously long in my opinion. Most meals we ate away from the hotel. What I highly recommend is getting a table at Kahunaville's outdoor patio for breakfast. The portions were huge and very reasonable. They have a fantastic fruit platter for only $9.99, and I mean a platter. It's a great solution for healthy eating for your kids.<br/>Other than that, check in was fast, staff were really pleasant and the room was very nice.

For the most part it was a very enjoyable stay. The rooms have been remodeled and updated. I must say, the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever had in a hotel. Check in was smooth and relatively fast, even thou the line was long they had plenty of people working the desk. I had requested a room with a view of the strip and was given a free upgrade. The swimming pool was good sized and well appointed. Service for the hotel and casino was friendly and helpful. I wish I could say the same for their restaurants. We tried most of the eateries there, and the food left a lot to be desired, and the service was slow and at times rude. Gilley's was fun and the food above average. We did experience fine service there. The Kahunanville Bar and Restaurant was fun and the food average. Breakfast there was worth the price, especially with the many coupons available for breakfast. The bartenders put on a show several times a night that must not be missed. This is a nice, centrally located hotel, at a good price. Other than the $22 a day, resort fee. You will find much more in hotels along the strip, but pay much more also. I would stay here again, but probably would prefer to stay at a hotel that had more to offer in clubs and restaurants.	4	-1	-1	-1	5	3	-1	5

I booked a package thru Expedia, getting round trip travel from Seattle and 3 nights for $458. By comparison, my husband, who booked his air travel a week before our trip paid $435 just to get his round-trip ticket.<br/>PROs:<br/>Spacious king-bed room on the 28th floor looking out on the Strip. Extremely clean, courteous, efficient staff. I spent 2 full days at the pool, renting a cabana on the 2nd day. I had no problems getting chairs at the pool. It's funny...lots of chairs had towels on them because people would leave the pool without depositing their towels in the dirty towel bin, leading many people to believe there were no available chairs. But my philosophy is that if you leave a hotel-provided towel on the chair and nothing else, you're not really claiming a chair so much as just dumping your towel. But back to my review - the main pool area didn't really have any servers for the general population unless you were lucky enough to flag one down from the edge of the pool. However, if you were in a cabana, the servers circulated about every 15-20 minutes. We got the cabana because we were celebrating a bachelor/ette weekend and had a large group and wanted to splurge a little - and it was worth every penny! It cost $250 for the day (peak price), but that gave us access to comfy pool chairs, a shaded cabana with seating for 4 plus a coffee table, misters right above our chairs, a mini fridge, and the frequent access to servers from 9am-8pm. Really a great bargain.<br/>The resort fee is $20/person which might make tyou think that it belongs in the CONs column, but that fee covers free in-room wifi access as well as fitness center access so it's really a pretty good deal, considering some other properties on the strip nickel and dime you for that stuff in addition to the standard resort fee.<br/>CONS:<br/>The Buffet is adequate, but nothing to write home about for $24/person.<br/>Our room (28068), though plenty comfortable had a few cosmetic blemishes...chipping paint on the bathroom sink counter (visible as you sit on the toilet and contemplate your existence), a corner protector which has separated from the wallpaper and flaps about aimlessly, low-flow showerhead with lime buildup around the sprayhead.<br/>Small tv in the room with few viewing options (but then, that is certainly the goal in Vegas isn't it...to make you want to leave your room)<br/>The pool area is very loud and party-like, which is probably exactly the atmosphere they're trying to cultivate to lure the 20-somethings to the hotel but isn't quite so good for the 30 and 40-somethings who just want to soak up the sun and talk to each other.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a great weekend and I would strongly recommend this hotel for travellers on a budget.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

Would I stay here again for this price, probably, but I would most likely look for deals at other places .<br/><br/>Previous reviews from travelers spoke of long waits at the check- in line. I arrived at 6PM and was helped within minutes. I never encountered any nasty or rude employees as other reviews have commented.. As for the smell other travelers mention, its true. But It is only located in the Casino area not the rooms and I've smelled worse. It was slightly musty, but the smell of cigarettes you encounter in every casino is a worse smell.<br/><br/>Upon check-in I asked for a room on a higher floor and was given the 34th floor. In the room, the carpet was old, stained and needs to be replaced. There was a stain on the chair and a dark stain on the white comforter. The air conditioning in the room wasnt that great, it was enough to keep the room cool, but I like a cold room.<br/>The bathroom was clean, had no issues. The walls are pretty thin, I woke up one morning to a child crying and screaming, it sounded like the kid was in my room.<br/>At one point, I was having difficulty with the television (volume wasnt working) so I called down to the desk, she was very polite and said she would send someone right up (and this was at 2AM) Within 5 minutes I had been able to play with the cables and the volume came back up so I called back down and cancelled the request for service, again she was very polite. <br/>I was pretty disappointed with the room, but not enough leave and check into a different hotel.<br/><br/>Location of the hotel isnt bad if you dont mind a little walking. There is a tram directly to the mirage that gets you closer to City Center hotels, no air conditioning on the tram, but its a short ride.<br/><br/>Most reviewers comment on the 22.40 daily &quot;resort fee&quot;, sure you dont use 22.40 worth each day but most hotels on the strip have the same fee. I paid about $330 for 4 nights....so adding this fee it turned out to be about 430 for the entire stay, still a decent price, but I have stayed at other places on the strip with much cleaner rooms for about $40 more, which I would probably pay the extra for.	3	-1	-1	-1	2	5	-1	4

I had a room with a great view..(you always pay extra for that) the room was comfortable but I could hear the other guest water running &amp; doors opening and closing all night. I always had a message waiting for me on the phone of a promotion or event for the night, one was @ Gilley's for bull riding event. I showed up, waited for 1 1/2 hours I asked someone to find out it was canceled because the bull broke the NIGHT BEFORE . hummm...why did they leave the message then? one night there was a trail of french fries from a room service cart to the elevators for over 11 hours, (I think someone could have cleaned that up) I'm not the type to leave a messy room, so if I use housekeeping it 's usually for clean towels or a quick run through,(I believe in tiping housekeeping also) my room service did not even make the bed that well ( it was actually worse then when I left it like they sat down and watched TV) or wipe up the glass rings left on the table.....I dumped my own trash..I was hopeing for just a quick cleaning. however these can be all solved with a call to housekeeping. I just chose to let it ride. I went to 5 restaurants there 1= I waited for 20 min with no help &amp; they weren't busy. 2= was just an average food over priced 3= way downhill compared to last year and 4= was pretty good. 5=was just starbucks I waited in line for 30 min to get breakfast &amp; a $5.00 house coffee it comes with a free refill, which I had to stand in line... again... to get, so not worth it (the service at the FRONT DESK was WONDERFUL and very friendly!!)	3	-1	-1	-1	3	5	-1	3

We arrive early and they were kind enough to take our luggage so we could gamble as we were told check-in would not be for several more hours. All was going well until check-in. First of all the lines were long and they only had about four people checking everyone in so it was a long slow process. After checking in, I asked if I had a strip view as I paid additional money for the strip view and was told yes. I inquired because I had read on Trip Advisor that some hotels would not give you a strip view unless you had your paperwork to prove you paid for it. Upon going up to my room, I realized that I did not have the strip view (but had a pool view) that I paid additional money for. I tried calling the front desk but no one answered so I was forced to go back down to the front desk to inquire about the view I paid for. I went back to the reservationist that checked me in and told her I had a pool view and not a strip view. She immediately begun to disagree and stated that if I looked up between two buildings I could see a piece of the strip and therefore it was in fact a strip view. I told her that all I could see was the pool and requested a manager. The Assistant Manager showed up and agreed with the reservationist so I requested a Manager. I was told I'd have to wait for the manager so I called the tour company that booked me and told them the situation, They agreed I did not have a strip view and said they would call the hotel. I waited at the desk at least thirty minutes before the Manager showed up and he agreed with the Assistant Manager and the Reservationist. I asked him if he had rooms that faced Las Vegas Blvd. and he said yes and I told him that was the strip view I paid for. He finally agreed to move me to another room after 40 plus minutes of disagreements and after I told him I was going to sue the hotel and no person in their right mind would say I had a strip view when all you saw was the pool when you looked out of the window. We were placed in a room with a partial strip view but at least we could look down the strip however, the room was so dirty and dustry we had to call housekeeping to clean it. A housekeeping supervisor was sent up and agreed the room needed cleaning so a housekeeper was sent in to clean the room while we sat there and made sure it was to our specifications. All of this really put a damper on the trip as it took about 45 minutes before we were issued a new room and an additional 30 minutes to get it cleaned and up to par. I will &quot;NEVER&quot; stay at Treasure Island again and would not advise anyone else to do so. The Manager acted like he was doing me a favor giving me a room with a strip view. I told him he was simply giving me what I paid for. These people were rude and arrogant and treated me like I had a lot of nerve requesting what I paid additional money for. I told the Manager it didn't make sense for a person to have to wait 45+ minutes to get what they paid for. I really believe they try to stick people who book with a tour company in the rooms with the pool view and those that reserve their rooms directly with them get the strip view. If you stay here, make sure you get what you pay for and be prepared to fight for it.	2	-1	-1	-1	1	1	-1	3

We read mixed reviews, specially reagrding the checkin in/out queues and pool. However, we had a very good experience. Both times we arrived quite late in the evening, so no checkin queues. However, the first time we checked in, the didn't have available a room with 2 queen bed (for a family of 2 adults + 2 children), since all these rooms were allready taken. After a short discussion, the reception manager upgraded us to a suite for the first night. By the way, the suite is one room, same as the regular room, which is big enough, with two bathrooms. So we decided to stick to the regular rooms with no extra pay.<br/>The rooms were spaceous and very clean, great beds, with a view. We were very happy with them. The hotel was full several days (weekend), but the only time we felt it, was when the valet parking was full and we had to go the upper level in the self parking, to find a parking place. It only happened once, and even so, the upper level wasn't full. Try to park on level 3 which connects directly to the hotel.<br/>Other than that, we didn't experience long queues at the (excellent) buffet restaurant or crowded pool. Maybe we were just lucky in picking the rights hours for breakfast &amp; pool :).<br/>We saw the Mystere show at the TI, very good as expected from cirque de soleil.<br/>We bought some shows tickets at a discount counter which is located very close to hotel, usually same-day tickets. The arrangment is not that comfy, there is usually a queue (you can bypass it by paying 25$ for VIP treat). You don't get assigned seats, but only sectores, and you have to exchange them to seats tickets at the show box office well before the performance time (before 4 pm). On the other hand, it saves money, so make you own decision.<br/>We didn't use the casino, alas, so we can't comment on it. As for the pool. it is small and actually not for swimming, but it's nice the spend some leisure time with children, cocktails or whatever.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	4	-1	5

Close to the Mall, Wynn Hotel, Palazzo and Mirage Hotel's Tram, I found it easy to walk through the casino and restaurants.<br/>I particularly enjoyed eating lunch at the Vietnamese restaurant ... I believe called &quot;Pho&quot;. The food was well prepared and tasty. I am very picky when I go to Las Vegas, but TI has always exceeded my expectations because of the front desk, bell desk and concierge service there.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

Flight plus three nights for @$400. I have always stayed at MGM, but thought I'd try something different this time. Treasure Island seemed like a better location, and the pirate ship and Gilley's looked like a fun time.<br/><br/>Gotta admit, I was a little nervous after reading the reviews. I already knew about the resort fee(because I research my trips and also read the fine print), so I was not astounded or angry about the resort fee, I just handed over the money. Also, I got such a good deal, it really didn't matter. But, that being said, the resort fee is just a way to get money. I used absolutely nothing that was included in the fee(pool, internet, spa, gym, newspaper(where do you get it) or notary(?)). Honestly have to say that I've never had an occasion to have something notarized on vacation. Good to know it would be free if needed, though. Sooo, I wasn't shocked by the fee, but find it extremely stupid nevertheless. Many of the casinos in Vegas do it, but may look for one of the casinos who don't next time. <br/><br/>I read all of the reviews about the long check-in/out lines, lack of workers. That wasn't my experience at all. The front desk was fully staffed, it took about 2 minutes to check in. The gal who checked us in was friendly enough, and we were on our way. Went up to our room. I was mortified when I stepped off of the elevator at the smell(very smoky), however, our room smelled nothing like the hallway, so it really wasn't too bothersome. Room was nice and clean enough. Beds and pillows were super comfortable, and our view was awesome! Bathroom was nice and very clean. Our safe was already locked upon arrival, so we called the front desk. There was someone up to open the safe almost immediately, so kudos to them! I was hoping for piles of money to be waiting in the safe for us, but that wasn't the case:( <br/><br/>I found the hotel to be very dark and kind of small, but also kind of liked the fact that it was on the smaller size. Service was normally pretty good. Went to many other casinos, and the only other casino where I was waited on was Bally's. Maybe it's my appearance, not sure. I always thought I was kind of attractive and looked like a good-tipper, but apparently not. Actually, all the service at TI was good(Bell desk was awesome, Gilley's servers were awesome, cocktail waiters were awesome, and most of the bartenders were awesome). There is one exception, though, that leaves kind of a sour taste in my mouth. My friend and I went to the bar to play Keno. I sat down, put $20 in, and was showing her how to play(she has never played before). Meanwhile, the bartender came up and asked us if we would like a drink(older lady). We ordered two bloody mary's and I continued w/trying to show her Keno. The bartender gives us the two drinks and say, &quot;That'll be 16 dollars.&quot; WTF. I asked why, since I was gambling, and she said that I wasn't betting a dollar(which I always bet, but wasn't at that particular moment because I was showing my friend how the game works) and that my friend wasn't gambling at all yet. I thought that was totally bogus considering that if she would have given us two minutes she would have seen that we were gambling &quot;enough&quot; to get free drinks. I personally probably lost @$300/day, so I think that counts for a couple of free ones. I now that there are rules so that people don't sit at the bar, bet a quarter, and expect a free drink, but that really put me in a bad mood for the rest of my stay. The cocktail waitresses were great, though, and I made sure to tip them plenty of money!<br/><br/>Buffet-just okay. Liked the sushi and the dessert bar was awesome! Had a 2 for 1 coupon(thanks resort fee!!!), so it was definitely worth the $10(after the resort fee coupon).<br/><br/>Gilleys-It was a lot of fun. Got some awesome nachos there that was a really huge portion size. Service was great both in the restaurant and bar part. Fun!<br/><br/>TI Siren Show-Fun to watch once. Kind of raunchy, but I kind of liked that. <br/><br/>Location-I thought the location was pretty good. Pretty close to everything, just a short walk, or monorail ride, or bus ride.<br/><br/>Pool-Didn't go there, but it looked like a fun time.<br/><br/>Casino-Kind of small, but fun! Had some fun slot machines, and they didn't seem to suck my money down quite as fast as the other casinos.<br/><br/>So, all in all it was a good deal. I would probably stay there again someday, but my next few trips I might try somewhere else just to mix it up.	5	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	5

It is right across from the Fashion Island mall which has great shopping and places to eat. It is also a bus stop for both bus lines that run on the strip which is convenient . The hotel itself was clean, check in was easy and our room was quiet and very clean with a comfortable bed and soft towels in the shower. The downfalls are that there is $20.00 a day resort fee as many hotels in Vegas have, that seemed worthless. We did not use the gym or the business office- who would while in Vegas and that was what the fee covers. The pool was nice, music played and it to was clean but you only got 1 towel to put on your chair. The awkward thing is that you have to walk through the casino and hotel to get to the pool. We ate that the restaurant-Kahunaville which served a good value breakfast for $6.99, eggs bacon and toast except the bacon was pretty crisp. Checkout was easy and they stored our bags as our flight left later in the day and got us a taxi which cost $16.00. The hotel has a Starbucks which just opened while we were there is it is opened 24 hrs. It is also across from a Walgreens which is across the street for any last minute things that you may need or just to get a snack. It is also across from Tickets for tonight so you can get cheap tickets to shows, I highly recommend Love which is at the Mirage and you can take a tram from Treasure Island if you didn't feel like walking. I am not much of a gambler, the casino in the hotel didn't have the greatest vibe like it was fun or that people were winning, it was a bit more lively at night. We went into the bar at the hotel Gilleys which was ok- not many people in there and just the servers line dancing all night. Overall , the location is great, terrific placement on the strip. The hotel was clean but some definite drawbacks.	3	-1	-1	-1	4	3	-1	4
UR117665127	BA2BD28F01A2B1F8FCA426CBB08954DB	Treasure Island - TI Hotel & Casino	Las_Vegas_Nevada	2011-09-04	Average at best.	3	6	We stayed because of a ridiculously low rate, something like $50/night, but we upgraded for $10 or $15 more to a strip view. HUGE disappointment. We expected windows across the span of our room, but the window actually was only about 1/3 of the width. In addition, it was placed on the edge of the room, in a direction that from bed gave us a nice view of the Rio and Palms casino. IF you wanted the strip view you literally had to walk up to the window and stand at an angle to look at the strip. It was a joke, but since we got in late, we didn't say anything to the front desk, but I can guarantee you having a room on the &quot;strip&quot; side of the hotel is very different from having a room with dead on views of the strip. If you make a reservation for &quot;strip view&quot; tell them your expectations right up front, otherwise, SAVE YOUR MONEY and take the base level room.<br/>This is supposedly AAA Four Diamond property. NOT in our book. We've stayed at plenty of 4 Diamonds and we were left scratching our head. Nothing extravagant about the room or the new furnishings, they were all very basic. The towels were old, tattered and of the cheapest quality. The bathroom amenities weren't any better than a two or three star, but for those who don't get to travel much, they might be inclined to snatch up every generic little bottle before the leave along with the generic kleenex. The pool isn't that large by Las Vegas standards. Service was so-so. Compare this pool to Mandalay, Hard Rock, Vdara, Wynn and you'll be left cold. The hotel has done zip to create an interesting environment like all the properties I just mentioned. What you get is a fairly large rectangular pool with a large slab of concrete and lots of cheap chaise lounges. <br/>The casino seemed more smokey than most casinos we go in and was no comparison in quality to the newer hotels. <br/>I have a feeling this will be forever relegated to having to offer incredibly cheap rates to get people in, unless it's a special event weekend and all of Las Vegas is booked. The $20 &quot;resort fee&quot; is a joke that offers a paper, use of the fitness facility, internet etc. It is very annoying and even properties like the Wynn are doing it to try and boost room revenues that they otherwise could not charge. It's an industry trend and gives you about as much value as being charged by an airline to check a bag. <br/>We can now say we tried to the property and were underwhelmed by it. Nothing was really wrong, it just wasn't a 4 Diamond in our opinion. We would not stay here again even with the $50 room rates, because it just didn't do it for us. If all you want is a bed and a shower then this offers value.	3	-1	-1	-1	3	4	-1	3

Overall, the hotel was a good value, but I wouldn't stay there again with any enthusiasm. Perks of this hotel are that the hotel and casino are both not huge, so you can get between places easily and without walking for miles. I could run down from room to the Starbucks on the first floor and be back in my room in 5 minutes; at Cesar's or the Venetian, this would take 20 minutes. I also like the location near the major shopping center. <br/><br/>My room was quite large, but the bathroom was in very poor condition with a damaged vanity and old fixtures. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was full of long, black hairs on arrival. I called housekeeping to request a more careful cleaning of the bathroom, but the housekeeper did not do better on any other day. None of the interactive features on my TV functioned. The thermostat in the room was totally antiquated, so I kept shooting between too warm and too cold. The rooms do not have a mini-bar or a coffee/tea maker. Internet access is included in the $21 daily &quot;resort fee&quot; that was added to my bill. Walls and doors are thin enough that you'll hear your neighbors and people in the hallway--and there are a lot of drunk college students at this hotel on weekends. Staff at check-in and check-out were efficient, but far from friendly, and no one ever asked me about my stay. <br/><br/>Overall, I felt TI felt a bit lacking. With better service, I could overlook the shabby rooms, or with nicer rooms, I could overlook the lackluster service. Ultimately, the combination of shabby rooms and lackluster service made this just a mediocre hotel stay for me.	4	-1	-1	-1	1	3	-1	3

I selected this hotel because it was affordable (I booked a room for $70 per night, plus the hotel charges a $20 ??esort fee? and has a good location (within walking distance of the much nicer and more expensive mega casino/hotels).<br/><br/>The good: 1. For an older hotel it is VERY well maintained. 2. The housekeeping staff were aggressive about cleaning the rooms ?which I really appreciate ?when I went out for breakfast and came back to the room, the room had been cleaned. However, be sure to use the Privacy door hanger, otherwise they will be at the door ready to clean your room before you are ready. 3. As I mentioned above, I selected this hotel because of the location, and this turned out to be a good decision ?easy walking to the other casinos. <br/><br/>Negatives: 1. The front desk staff is not friendly (one female employee was loudly rude to some guests checking-in who were clearly struggling to understand her ?English was not their first language) ?this was not a big issue for me, as I only needed to deal with them once, at check-in. 2. The restaurants and food stores are overpriced. I ate at the buffet one morning and it was not very good ?I ate at other places for less money and the food was better. The Starbuck?? both out front and in the casino charges nearly $2.00 more compared to what back home for my usual drink.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	4	-1	4

The room was spacious, clean, and well appointed with excellent views. The pool was small and colder than expected, but had a great DJ on Saturday. We ate most of our meals within the hotel and everywhere we ate was excellent. Close to shopping and walking distance of other great restaurants and attractions. Almost all of the staff we met were pleasant and helpful with the exception of one particularly nasty blackjack dealer who felt like she needed to insult and belittle anyone who dared to sit at her table. At one point myself and 2 other people got up and left. The others were pleasant and loved to chat people up. One drawback of this hotel (like most in Las Vegas) was the disgusting stench of cigarette smoke. Not only that, but every hotel/casino we went into felt like they needed to attempt to cover up the disgusting smell with a perfume like cleaner. (ugh). It was enough to make us feel sick. We often tried to stay outside, or do our shopping at outdoor malls. That being said, we definitely enjoyed our stay and would have stayed there again except for the comp. guy on our last stay. Two other couples who were with us were each comped with 2 free nights stay and 200 in food credits. When it was my husbands turn, he was rudely asked &quot;what do you want?&quot; and &quot;you've never been here before...&quot; (neither had either of the other couples). We weren't expecting a lot, but a free drink would have been nice. We didn't really appreciate being treated so rudely by this person on our last day and it just soured the whole treasure island experience for us unfortunately. Probably will try a different hotel on our next stay.	2	-1	-1	-1	4	3	-1	4

I had a security come to the room and i had to fill out a report which was a waste of time because nothing was done about it. I talked to the hotel managment and i wasnt compensated for any of it.. I refused to pay the resort fee for each night i stayed there, but was forced to. I had long distance phone calls made on my phone, when nobody in the room had even made a phone call out. This hotel is a joke and i will NEVER recommend it to anyone. Treasure island is pretty run down, and if youre looking to book something nice in the same budget i would go with the MIrage. Thanks Treasure island for the awful time.	1	-1	-1	-1	1	1	-1	1

However, there is also an abundance of good values and here was one we couldn't pass up! We hadn't been to TI before, so we were looking forward to the experience. Location was great- got Le Reve tickets and a quick walk across the connecting pathway from one of the exits of Treasure Island led us to the Wynn. We also wanted to shop at the Forum Shops and a complimentary tram ride to MGM made it just a brief walk to Caesar's. If you're walking the strip- it's a good location too, but far from Mandalay Bay if you want to end up there at any time. Room looked newly renovated- clean and spacious. We didn't try the pool area, but it looked nice. Overall, it's a huge place with machines and eateries galore. We ate at a few of the places in the hotel and were very satisfied and the buffet provided better dessert than food, but for a 2 for 1 deal couldn't complain.<br/>If you're looking to be comfortable at this end of the strip with a somewhat central location, this is a great choice.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

It had been about 5yrs since the last visit.<br/>Let's list the bad first:<br/>1) Treasure Island Hotel was a very average experience<br/>2) Traffic as bad as ever- be prepared to walk- or choose a great hotel<br/>3) If you're on a family trip, walking the strip is like something out of Blade Runner- crowded, full of street advertisers for the porn shows- always sticking cards &amp; flyers in your face as you try to pass. Not a big deal if you're single, but not family friendly.<br/>4) Even bargain hotel prices won't help much- everything you don't get a deal on is expensive (i.e. $4 bottle of water)<br/>5) Mixed pool area- was not family friendly environment at all!<br/><br/>Now for some of the good:<br/>1) Mystere show is excellent!<br/>2) Treasure Island dinner buffet is almost worth the $30/person price- pasta bar was the best!<br/>3) Lake Mead is only 1/2 hr away<br/><br/>That's really all we enjoyed- As we toured the strip, I kept asking myself, &quot;what are we doing here?&quot; For about 10years, Vegas had some great family options in a lot of places. Now, they're few &amp; far between- definitely back to the &quot;What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas&quot; theme. <br/>TI is not a bad place to stay, but even at ? price, I expected more- TV was too small for the room, only 1 pool- they really need a family &amp; singles pool, beds were small for queen size, but comfortable (if you like softer mattress). Staff was friendly.	2	-1	-1	-1	4	3	-1	3

I booked this place through Priceline for $55. The room was very clean and comfortable. We got a room with partial strip view on the 23rd floor. The check in process was a breeze. There was no one when we checked in at 1 am on a weekday. <br/><br/>Priceline rated it at 4* which I think is correct and valid. The location is awesome with easy access to strip on one side and the downtown on the other. There is easy way out to other places as it not in the middle of the strip but at the end. Venetian is right across the street and Mirage is right next to it.<br/><br/>Guests get VIP seating for TI show. The casino and shops were good. We got a buy one get one free buffett though we didn't make it.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is the lack of decent coffee and inexpensive breakfast in the hotel. Starbucks located in the hotel was a rip off. Too expensive and the cups are half full. The hotel is older than few other hotels but it is not a run down place. <br/><br/>A great value and good location makes it one of the best places to stay in Vegas.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	4	-1	5

It would give us something to do during the day since there aren't a lot of kid-friendly activities nearby (when not doing day trips). We were surprised how pricey hotels were! From the photos, it looked like Treasure Island's pool fit the bill, and the price was mid-range. The room was clean and smoke free (as we requested). And even though it is at the top of the strip, it's close enough in to walk to everything. However, the pool was a disaster. From morning until night it was packed with guests just standing in the water with buckets of beer along the edge of the pool, drinking in the pool, many smoking in pool chairs nearby, and a DJ blasting music so loud we could barely hear each other talk (and could even hear it in our room). None of us had any room or, frankly, any desire to swim or even sit down by the pool and read! While I know hotels like this aren't catering primarily to families, It was a huge disappointment and, frankly, a shock, to see a pool facility so loud, dirty, and, quite frankly, seeming unsafe.	3	-1	-1	-1	3	3	-1	3

Staff was very friendly and gave us 3 &quot;partial strip view&quot; rooms, which turned out to have great views down the strip, facing Mirage.<br/><br/>Room is very nice. Well decorated, clean and AMAZING beds. Bathroom is nice and comes with nice toiletries (steal them every time, they replenish them every day!) and a good shower. <br/><br/>Do notice the capital &quot;amazing&quot; when I described the beds. These beds are truly amazingly comfortable. Six hours in this bed felt like 10 hours in my own bed (or maybe that was just the jetlag messing with me).<br/><br/>Everything else about TI is very nice as well. It's by no means as fancy as Wynn or Bellagio, it appeals more to a younger crowd. The casino offers good gaming, there's many restaurants (including a Starbucks!) and a nice pool.<br/><br/>Oh, and the &quot;Sirens of TI&quot; show is very cheesy, but sexy and good fun.	5	-1	-1	-1	5	5	-1	5

We went at 6pm and it was so dirty,. Towels lying on the floor everywhere, people drinking a lot, the water was not clean. We stayed 5 min and left!<br/>- Car park is free and easy to access.<br/>- Restaurants: we went to the &quot;Cowboy&quot; type restaurant (can't remember the name). The food was good and the portions big. There was also a good atmosphere with country dancing. <br/>- Show: the Pirates show is good but nothing amazing.

You can usually land a great rate, the rooms are all updated, and the beds are comfortable. Also, housekeeping is efficient, breakfast buffet is worth the $20, and it's one of the better casinos for slot play. I like the fact that TI is not so enormous. It doesn't take forever to get to and from your room. We stayed at Aria, and I swear it was 20 minutes walk from room to strip. TI is a solid value. The $20/night resort fee perturbs me a bit, just add it to the price! It's mandatory anwyays! Also the check-in line is long, but checkout is a breeze on the TV. We'll stay here again.<br/><br/>Oh yeah another negative to mention - the pool closes at 7pm. WAY to early for Vegas! Should be open til 11.	4	-1	-1	-1	4	4	-1	4

This time we chose TI for the combination of price and location. The price was very fair in comparison to Bellagio, Ceasars, Venetian and Wynn, and in line with Mirage. The TI is an &quot;older&quot; hotel, and it really feels that way when you're in it. The ceilings are quite low and it is quite dark and dingy feeling. Other than Canters I can't think of another restaurant in the hotel that we would eat at again. The buffet was very poor and hardly worth it, despite it's low price point. Even my kids said the only decent thing there was the cotton candy.<br/>The pool area was disappointing. The pool is small and of course, it's quite a party hotel so once the partiers wake up and make their way down to the pool there is not much room for anyone else. Fun to watch them make fools of themselves but not for long.<br/>If you have younger kids to get to sleep, don't get a room that overlooks the pirate ship ... the noise from the late performances can be heard in the room.<br/>On the second night we were offered 2 for 1 tickets to Mystere so we sent the kids to the show and hit the casino for a couple of hours.<br/>If we were on a budget we'd stay there again but we preferred the other hotels best.	3	-1	-1	-1	3	3	-1	3

I read all the boards and blogs very thoroughly before booking anywhere. I have to admit that I was a little nervous booking TI. I found an amazing deal directly on their website and booked it as a backup plan since I had up to 48 hours prior to arrival to cancel it. My husband and I are both in our early 30s and have been to Vegas 3 times prior but only during the winter months. We have stayed at Excalibur, Stratosphere, and the Venetian. (Odd mix, I know). This trip we also spent a night at Harrah's since it was free. I am also posting a review on that hotel. We ended up sticking with TI as we could not find anything comparable to the 4 star rating for less than twice the price.<br/><br/>So.....I was very nervous checking in. We arrived at 10:30 am on a Saturday. We were told there were only smoking rooms ready. However, they stored our luggage for us and told us we were free to use the facilities. We went down to Bally's and saw the 2:30 show for The Price is Right (which I do not recommend!). We arrived back at the hotel at 5:00 and checked in to our room. Check in was only about a 15 min wait. My husband did the $20 bill trick and we were upgraded to a high floor with 180 degree views of the strip and the pirate show below. It was nice to leave the curtains open at night and use the lights of Vegas as a nightlight. The room itself was a decent size - not huge, but big enough for a couple. There was a desk with a flat screen TV, a chaise lounge, a king bed, and two nightstands. There was an iphone/ipod docking station (that only plays music and does not charge the device). The closet was decent size with a safe inside. We called the front desk and they happily brought up a mini fridge within 30 minutes. It was pretty beat up and on a horrible rolling cart that they insisted we keep but it worked (not super cold). The bed and linens were very nice and comfortable. The bathroom was very updated with granite countertops. I was very surprised with how updated the room seemed compared to the casino.<br/><br/>The location of the hotel cannot be beat. We utilized the Walgreens across the street several times to get alcohol, water, soft drinks, and snacks. It was easiest to take the bridge and then take the escalator down. We also walked down to Bally's, Bellagio, and Caesar's. These were very easy walks with some great people watching. Also, there is a free tram that runs back and forth to the Mirage. <br/><br/>The casino at TI was terrible. They do have some very pretty blackjack dealers - Gilley Girls - but the place was dead. The casino looks very run down and dirty. We didn't spend a lot of time there. We much preferred Harrah's or the Mirage to gamble.<br/><br/>The swimming pool was very cool. We came with another couple that stayed at the Mirage so we spent an entire day at that pool. It was a beautiful and huge pool, but you are packed in like sardines. It made it less than enjoyable. At TI, we rented a cabana for $180 for 9-5. It had a mini fridge that was stocked with sodas, fruit, and water. There is a couch, a chair, a coffee table, and three lounge chairs. We had coupons for a $7.99 breakfast that they delivered directly to our cabana. (We got these coupons at checkin and they applied them to everyone in our cabana. Great hangover food). We had a personal cabana host and a personal waitress. Our waitress, Shauntelle, was awesome - love her!! Beer was about $55 for a bucket of 8 Coronas. Not terrible. (Mirage had a Bud Light cooler with 8 beers for $50 and you got to keep the cooler). The pool itself was pretty small but never really got crowded. There were a few kids around. It was mainly 20 and 30 somethings drinking and sunning. It never really got rowdy. However, as a parent, I would not take my child to the pool after about 2pm. People got drunker than I would like my kids to see.<br/><br/>Restaurants - We had Kahunaville for lunch one day. The spinach-artichoke dip looked and tasted like throw up. I think my husband and I both didn't feel well after that. Service was slow and our waiter was horribly rude and unattentive. Kahunaville also served our breakfast at the pool but the food was actually really good. So, it is hard to recommend either way. We also ate at the steakhouse although I don't remember the name of it. The food was all excellent. I recommend the calamari for an appetizer. No one at our table was disappointed. <br/><br/>All in all, I would stay at TI again. I like to experience a lot of different casinos while in Vegas and use my hotel as a base to shower and sleep. For me, TI fits that bill perfectly. I will probably stay at TI again but never ever gamble there unless they do a lot of remodeling.	5	5	-1	5	-1	4	-1	-1

We were very unhappy of their service!! There was no kettle in the room so we just asked for hot water for our baby. Someone promised to send us hot water over the phone. After waiting for 30 minutes, no one show. We called again and the guy answered the phone very rude and said they will only come if we tips at least 7 dollars. We never encounter any hotel requst tips before their service.	3	3	-1	3	4	1	-1	-1

We tried the cheap price point (Stratosphere) and also the Venetian across the street.<br/><br/>The price was fair in comparison and we had a corner room overlooking the strip and the pirates show. I think we got a very nice room for the money we've paid and were super happy. The rooms are nice appointed and clean, they are of course not super posh but are still comfy and trendy. We loved their mattress and also the bedding, nice touch there. <br/><br/>We calculated the resort fee in when we booked, so were not surprised by those. I have to admit though, that they could offer a bit more for the $19 they charge a day. It is nice to have free wifi, but the bogo free for the buffett is not a deal. We went there once and won't come back again. The food is really not good at all for what they charge, we were happy we paid just for one. They either have to opt up their game and work on better food, or lower the price significantly. You also pay for the pool, which is super small and fills up quickly. I liked the atmosphere there, good music and young people... but still, it is small and they can't change that.<br/><br/>The casino itself is not the best on the strip, it is dark, feels a bit dingy and they don't have as much choice as others on the strip. We played several times, but we also went out to other places.<br/><br/>Overall, we would pick the hotel again for the price we paid. You can't beat the location and it was clean. I hope they work on their food though, that would be the major minus about the hotel.	4	5	-1	4	-1	4	-1	-1

The bed was super comfortable, we slept like royalty. I like that there is a Starbucks immediately outside TI and there is also a 24 hour restaurant inside the hotel. The hotel/casino has some fun restaurants and clubs inside it also. TI is in a great location on the strip, close to the &quot;newer&quot; Vegas hotspots, the mall, and highway access. The free show is always a must. The service throughout TI was excellent and the room rates are reasonable. We will stay here again.	5	5	-1	5	-1	5	-1	-1

We had an end corner room on the 23rd floor and there were windows on both sides of the corner so the view was fantastic! My only complaint is the lack of a clock.

We finally stayed there for two nights -- and it was pretty average. The rooms are very similar to the room layout at the Mirage -- but the furnishings and accessories are much better at the Mirage. Everything about the TI is a cut below the Mirage. But especially the check-in. We stood in a long line waiting to check in with one of the two front desk clerks -- and then one of them went on break. By the time we got to the front of the line, there were about 50 people behind us. Fortunately someone from the &quot;high rollers&quot; section of the front desk checked us in. The hotel does have a good location and has a train connecting it to the Mirage. With all the options in Vegas, probably won't stay here again unless the rate is LOW!	4	4	-1	2	-1	2	-1	-1

TI was having a such GREAT deal on rooms my cousin and I stayed there on our 1st night in Vegas for a girls trip. The location could not have been more perfect. From our room you could see down the entire strip! The front desk staff were very pleasant when we checked (sometime close midnight). The room was very spacious, and clean. We couldn't hear the neighbors who shared an adjoining room, which was a good think. The next day pool was fun filled with people sun bathing, there was a DJ playing music and kept the environment lively. If you can catch a great deal at this hotel it is definietly worth the stay.	5	4	-1	4	-1	4	-1	-1

Bed is really comfortable and they had put us on the 34th floor. My only complain is the room we got had the window air vent not closing properly ... so you hear the noises outside the hotel even though your on the almost top floor. As soon as I complained in the morning they gladly gave me a new room and send someone to fix the window. Although we ended up staying in the same room coz its close to the elevator and the window is fixed already :) Hope we can get another good deal on this Hotel for Nov 2011 ... planning to go back there again with friends.	5	5	-1	4	-1	4	-1	-1

This was my third trip to Las Vegas and my first stay at Treasure Island. Personally, Treasure Island is not my favorite hotel that I've stayed in but it does have some great qualities.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/>1. TI runs amazing deals through their Facebook Page and e-mails which is the reason we booked. Comparable hotels' rates did not compare to the low rates offered at TI.<br/>2. TI is centrally located on the Strip and just a few minutes walk to some amazing attractions and transportation.<br/>3. We booked a Strip View and non-Strip View room and when we checked in, they gave us two adjoining Strip View rooms free of charge, which was nice. <br/>4. We received vouchers for their free breakfast buffet which came in handy - we ate there every morning and they had a pretty good selection.<br/>5. The CASINO! I'm a slot girl all the way and the payout at TI was fantastic. I was up every day I was there and on our last day, after checkout, I hit for $925 on the penny slots. Not a bad parting gift!<br/><br/>The bad:<br/>1. Treasure Island has a 'signature scent' pumped through their vents - and it is SO overpowering. When entering the hotel from the street or the parking garage, it hits you like a brick wall. I can't describe the scent, but it is definitely floral and almost grandmother-ish. Not a welcoming scent at all - but according to them, some people love it.<br/>2. My parents had a terrible experience at Gilley's - homeless people were roaming the restaurant picking food off of plates left by people. <br/>3. The entire hotel, rooms included, could use a face lift. Everything seems old and dated and even the restaurant/bar choices are a bit dated as well. <br/>4. We stayed in January so we were unable to use the pool, but it looked small from our window. I've seen much bigger and better pools in Vegas and for a hotel called Treasure Island, I expected more in that area.<br/><br/>Overall, like I said, I probably wouldn't stay at Treasure Island again - but I will definitely gamble there!	4	5	-1	3	-1	4	-1	-1

Exceptional staff at Treasure Island got us is our room by 9am. The 34th floor with a great view of the strip. Everything was great and the beds are the best. I had no early morning backache. I stayed at the Venetian in June and was disappointed there were no drawers for our clothes and they did not give any shampoo, conditioner and lotion after the first day. TI had plenty of drawers to unpack our things and we got extra toiletries daily. They also gave coupons for reduced drinks and food. That doesn't happen at the Venetian.<br/>We often used the tram between TI and the Mirage. Never waited more than 1 minute!<br/> I will stay at TI again.	5	5	-1	5	-1	5	-1	-1

The room was much nicer than what we had at Caesar's last year for more money. <br/><br/>Buffet was pretty good. They gave us vouchers for free buffets, but didn't tell us they were valid only monday - friday, it was on the voucher, but when checking in on a Friday that should be pointed out instead of putting them in an envelope for later.<br/><br/>The pool is much smaller than other hotels on the strip, but was plenty nice and crowded.<br/><br/>Got upgraded to a 'strip view' without asking, as did our whole party, so may not need to pay for that.	5	4	-1	4	-1	3	-1	-1

Today, in the era of the Wynn, Encore, Aria....etc, Treasure Island is a faded star. The rooms are fine but feel dated. No flat screen tv. The casino is old school, very tightly packed and smokey. Contrast this with the Venetian and Palazzo across the street which just feel much nicer and more pleasant. That said, room rates for Treasure Island are substantially less than those other hotels. I didn't get to spend much time there, but the pool didn't seem very busy or exciting but I was there midweek for a business event. Weekends might be a little better?<br/>The Sirens of TI show is still quite a draw. Sexy girls and a few guys bring lots of people to watch. One potential downside is that some of the rooms face directly down on the show and the shows run well into the evening with the last show running close to midnight and from my room on the 25th floor I could watch and hear the show pretty well, including the fireworks that blasted right up past my room. It wasn't a problem for me, but one of the people I was there with (a woman) wasn't happy. She's one of those people who needs 8 hours of sleep a night and we had to be at our business function early in the mornings.<br/><br/>Overall, TI is still a good hotel, but nothing really special compared to some of the many other properties in Vegas today.	3	4	-1	3	-1	3	-1	-1

I was expecting the check in line to be super long from reading all the reviews. It was long but it moved pretty fast so we were in line for about 20 minutes which didn't seem long since we were kinda tipsy from the champagne from the limo ride! We checked in on a Thursday and we saw the line for check-in on Friday and it was 3x longer than ours was.<br/><br/>We had a deluxe room but asked if a strip view room was available and he put us in one with no extra charge! Our room was clean and the view was great from the 10th floor. Yes they charge the $22/day resort fee but we knew this way ahead of time and planned for it. <br/><br/>The only time we had to complain is because on the website it said 2 for 1 lunch and dinner buffet. So when we decided to use it on our last night we noticed it said breakfast or lunch only so we called them and told them what it says on there website and they checked it out and gave us the coupon that says 2 for 1 lunch or dinner.<br/>They also give you 2 for 1 cocktails that you can use and Kahunnaville passes out tons of 2 for 1 cocktail coupons.<br/><br/>The buffet was fine we went for breakfast and dinner both once. We signed up for the players club card and got $10 in free play and an extra $5 in free play. <br/><br/>We liked the location because its next to the mall and across from wynn, encore, palazzo and Venetian and close walking distance to the<br/>more middle strip hotels. The pirate show was corny... &quot;Who you calling ahoy!&quot; Lol! That's what the ladies in the show said! But watching the ship sink was cool.<br/><br/>Overall we enjoyed our stay and are planning on staying again when we come back next year.	4	5	-1	4	-1	3	-1	-1

Amazing view of the strip! Room was average size but clean and the bed was very comfortable. My only complaint was the frequent emergency vehicle sirens that you could hear on Las Vegas Blvd during the late night hours. Also, the TV was small and wasn't in an area that made viewing user friendly. Buffett was OK - food wasn't hot but mildly warm as the buffett wasn't crowded and food was sitting a bit too long. However, Pasta's are made fresh to order and are yummy. Casino is nice size but not overly large like others. I would recommend TI because its fairly priced and has an excellent location - near Fashion Mall and other high end resorts such as the Wynn. Clean place and employees were very accommodating. Pool area was also nice and wasn't crowded. We easily tracked down chairs and waitress'.	5	5	-1	4	-1	5	-1	-1

Also the room was spotless when we arrived which I was very happy about since I read some reviews that said otherwise. One thing I loved about TI was the fact that you could get from your room to the strip in a matter of mins. vs. some of the larger hotels that could take 15 min.

Only one sink though when there is plenty of space for two. Didn't actually eat at the hotel or use the casino. Spent time at the Venetian which is just across the walkway and got provisions from Walgreen which is attached to the Venetian. There is also easy access to the Fashion Show Mall from the casino floor. I only had two issues; the compulsory resort fee of $22.40 and my desk chair had stuffing escaping from a split seam.

We have never been disappointed in our rooms and the food is great. I find the price of rooms to be very reasonable and the food is what you will find price wise anywhere else on the strip. We especially love Kahunaville, Canter's and Gilley's. It is so easy to get around the hotel and out to the strip or over to the Mirage in a few short steps. We have had to wait in line at check in for 30 minutes tops, and we have always been on a higher floor. We also enjoy having a room that faces Siren's Cove so we can see the show. If the fireworks going off will keep you from sleeping, maybe you should ask to be on the back side of the hotel. We do love coming here and we will keep coming back. Last trip we were upgraded to a panoramic room, which would not be worth the extra money, just a strip view would be good.	5	5	-1	5	-1	5	-1	-1

The best part of staying at this hotel was definately the location. It's a short walk to many of the big name hotels and shows. Other than the location this hotel was just average. A 4 star perhaps, but it doesn't deserve the 5 stars many of the travel companies give it. The decor is a bit dated due to the pirate theme, but you can see they've tried to make improvements and updates here and there. Somewhat oddly, the lobby smells of French soap.<br/><br/>Rooms<br/>The deluxe room was small and clean. The bathroom was oddly dark. Worst part of this hotel was that the towels all smelled like burned hair. The smell was strong enough to linger on your hands after you washed and dried them. Yuck! The strip view was cool, but not worth the extra money we paid for it, just because the window itself was so small and oddly placed in the corner of the room.<br/><br/>Casino<br/>We don't play, but we did hear this is a good hotel for beginners to learn tables due to low minimums and afternoon lessons certain days of the week. <br/><br/>Service/Food<br/>The &quot;Sirens of TI&quot; show (which btw was just terrible) we sat at the outdoor bar for a drink. I think it was called Sirens Cove. The staff there were exceptionally rude. To make it short, there was approx 30 people at the bar all of which were forced to purchase an overpriced drink (otherwise you had to pay cover). The show itself is quite short, and the service was slow. So basically we got our drinks, and weren't quite done by the time the show ended. 5 minutes after the show ended, much to our surprize we were all told (rudely) &quot;Shows over. Everyone out&quot;. We were shocked. We thought we could at very least sit and finish our drinks, not so. Another two minutes later they came and ushered all of us out. Not nice...<br/>For meals, we tried Pho, it was one of the worst bowls I've had, but the Margarita at Isla was quite good.<br/><br/>Pool<br/>The area was a little small, but it was nice and relatively quiet in the mornings, there seemed to be quite a few families. They start bumping music in the afternoon, but we would head in around that time.	2	4	-1	3	-1	1	-1	-1

So I chose to stay for three nights at the Treasure Island right across the street. There is a bridge over Las Vegas Blvd. connecting the two properties making the walk quick and accessible. I paid $69 for Thursday night and $129 for Friday night and $149 for Saturday night. This was a savings of $100-$200/nt. The room was standard/small but very nice and had everything you need. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. Unless you have a business expense plan, or are wealthy, I don't know why you'd pay more for a larger room just to sleep in. If you really want to gamble you can always cross back over to the Venetian or go downtown cause the TI casino is low-mid class. However, just to sleep, it?? a good deal. As usual there is a $20 resort tax but that covers some things (like internet and pool). BTW, the bus stop to the airport ($7.00) is right at the end of the driveway but don't expect the bell captain to inform you about the airport shuttle. The cab ride to airport is about 35.00 (tip incl).	-1	4	-1	4	-1	-1	-1	-1

Check in was great and Josh was very helpful and friendly. Had a room on the 35th floor with a terrific Strip view, which balanced the fact that my reserved King had morphed into 2 Queens, Got all ready for bed and went to set the alarm and found that my iPod dock clock radio was defective. Called Housekeeping and they sent a lovely guy up with a brand new Sony. Next morning while getting ready at 6:00AM realized that there were no wash clothes or bathmat. Made do and called housekeeping again and asked that some be left when my room was cleaned. They left a bathmat and 4 wash clothes. When I got back to the room Wednesday night, found that the room had not been cleaned. Called Housekeeping again and they sent someone up right away and she was delightful (Jean from Belize).<br/><br/>So up to this point there were issues, but the staff were just fantastic. Then came checkout day. The girl at the desk was a bit snotty and seemed to not understand that internet fees were included in the 'Resort Fee' and those charged automatically by the service needed to be deducted. I don't know if they are trained to try to NOT refund them or if she was just being thick, but either way it wasn't very pleasant. Checked my bags with the bellman to go off to my last morning of the conference and he was kind of short with me too. The worst part was when I came to get my bags at about 3:00. The place was not very busy but a line was forming and most of the 5 or 6 guys working were not busting their butts to get people moving. Waited 20 minutes to get my bags and the guy stands there with his hand out. Sorry, but if you had seemed to be making any effort beyond the bare minimum, you would get a tip, but not this time. Didn't say that, but as I walked off he called the guy I was sharing a cab with an [--].<br/><br/>So all in all the stay was fine. The room was comfortable and most of the staff were very nice and helpful. Got to expect there are going to be a couple of bad apples in a place that big.<br/><br/>And why do non of the hotels in Vegas have coffee in the rooms. That totally stinks!	3	4	-1	3	-1	4	-1	-1

You can reach Venetian and Forum Shop infer minutes. If you need to reach the new area (Cosmopolitan Center), I suggest to take a taxi.<br/><br/>ROOM<br/>The room is big. I was at 4th floor and the view was terrible... I closed the curtains every time I enter the room because the view was on the roof of another building. Be careful when you book: ask an upper floor with a good view (probably you need to pay more, but in Vegas you need to pay more for everything!).<br/>The size of the room is good, I was in a single room, but I had 2 king beds. Also the bathroom is quite big.<br/>The problem is that everything in the room is too old, not very clean, not very good. The moquette seems to be dirty and the sofa was dusty. <br/>The shower didn't work properly and the basin needs to be changed.<br/>If you think how much you pay for this room, it's a shame that they don't make some new improvements. <br/><br/>BREAKFAST and DINNER<br/>During check-in the staff of the hotel gave us some tickets. The breakfast was not included in the cost of the room, so we used these free buffet tickets in order to have breakfast and dinner. The buffet is really good, full of everything and you have a very big choice. The quality of the food is quite good, for sure they can improve and offer something better... But maybe for this price or for free we can't ask to have something more. Be careful because you need to wait 15/30 minutes before to have your seat and table. <br/><br/>STAFF<br/>The staff is very kind and the service is very fast, both for check-in and check-out.<br/><br/>CASINO<br/>I don't gamble, but I think there are many better casinos in Las Vegas. This is very old.<br/><br/>POOL AREA<br/>I took a look there and for sure, also this part of the hotel needs to be renewed if they want give the same standard of the other hotels.<br/><br/>In the end I suggest to choose a different hotel for your stay in Las Vegas, probably you'll pay e same, but you'll have something better.<br/><br/>In the end, if you	2	4	-1	2	-1	2	-1	-1

We stayed here for two nights after about a week of camping and not so nice hotels. When we got to the hotel the line to check in was enormous. We had to wait about 45 minutes to get our room keys. That was the worst part of our stay there. When we got to our room everything was immaculate. The washroom was spotless and everything else was very clean. The toiletries provided were from the spa in the hotel and smelled dreamy. The pool area was clean and comfortable. There was always enough chairs for everybody. I'm not a big fan of childen, of which there was quite a few in the pool area, but that's not the hotel's fault. The hallways were very air conditioned, to the point that it was cold. The beds were super comfortable with very nice, high quality sheets. I would definitely stay here again.	4	5	-1	5	-1	5	-1	-1

It's on the north end of the strip so be prepared for some walking in order to see the sites...but a $7 day pass on bus can get you back to hotel once feet start to hurt. Starbucks is in the hotel as well as one just outside with Walgreens across the street providing any necessities. Fashion Mall is also next door with tons of shops and food court. Only tried the buffet here with a 2 for 1 coupon and it was great with little bit of everything. Pool was nice, party atmosphere on weekends....relaxing during the week. Casino floor was going 24/7 with everyone willing to take the time to explain games we weren't familiar with. It isn't a 5 Star...but for a place to sleep and hang out while exploring the sites it was awesome!!	4	4	-1	5	-1	5	-1	-1

First of all, for the price ($100 a night) and the location we could not do better. The hotel was clean, not too smoky, not too long a walk to get from the elevator shafts to the strip, which is nice at the end of the night and you wanna chop off your feet because they hurt. The pool is small, but nice. Not too busy<br/><br/>The rates can skyrocket to $400 a night which it's not that kind of hotel. That aside let me move on to the things I dis not score this higher.<br/><br/>We made our reservations in March and requested a King Non-smoking room, I sent an email regarding this and was told it would not be a problem. <br/><br/>We arrive on September 11 and checked in at 9pm. upon check-in I was given the option of two Queens non smoking or King smoking. Not what I requested and told advised them of my request. I was rudely advised that check in starts at 3pm and rooms are first come first serve. Something I was not made aware of. I was also confronted with a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; tone and attitude. So we took it, much to our displeasure. <br/><br/>I must say, the smoking room was not bad. Very clean and nearly odor free. By the second night we were either used to the smell of cigarettes from the casino, or it had actually gone away. The beds are soft, good if you like a pillow top bed. If you are a firm bed kind of person you might not get a good night sleep. The rooms were spacious and clean. Mini fridge and in-room safe were nice to have.<br/><br/>6 days later is when the fun, lies and rudeness started. The night before checking out I had called front desk asking if we could have an hour extension for checking out. I was told to check again at 8am that morning and they would see what they could do. That morning I went down to the desk at 8am and stood in the check in line to make my inquiry. A lady walked up to me and told me that the check in desk does is closed and does not open until 10am, that if I had any questions to call instead. So I did, and 5 minutes later I called the desk. When I asked if we could extend our check out time by an hour I was told that &quot;they were busy checking in customers at the moment and needed all the rooms cleared by 12pm&quot;. I was floored by this, I informed the person that I was just downstairs and they were not checking anyone in as there was no one in line, and also informed them that one of their desk staff told me that they do not open the check in desk until 10am. There was a long pause, and then the person told me in a stuttering tone that they needed the rooms for the 10 o'clock check ins. I asked if it was 10am or 3pm as earlier that week I was told that check in started at 3pm. Again a pause and told that they could not help.<br/><br/>A little honesty would have been nice, not robotic predetermined answers. <br/><br/>In general, we would return for the right price as it was a great location, close to the Fashion Show Mall, Wynn, Palazzo, Venetian, Forum Shoppes. Easy transfer for the Express to the North Premium Outlet, Convenient. As for the staff, well, now we know not to expect much from them.	3	5	-1	4	4	2	-1	2

The hotel was very good for the money. All the usual coffee shops, restaurants and bars (as well all the slots and gambling tables). They heavily pushed Gilley's, which is a rodeo/cowboy themed bar with girls dressed in minimal clothing, but I didn't have time to visit the place. Seemed odd though given the name of the hotel conjuring thoughts of pirates, boats and treasure on desert Islands. There WAS the show at the front of the hotel with the fireworks, boats and pirates, so thankfully my thoughts were not completely wrong. The room was big, and in good condition - no complaints there! I didn't visit the pool or gym but I was assured there was one. Phil's Italian Steak House I did visit and that was great. The steak was amazing and the wine was good too. I would recommend eating there, but make sure you have your spending money to hand as it was on the expensive side (but having said that Las Vegas seemed more expensive this trip,compared to previous trips). Anyway, if you want to stay on the strip the Treasure Island is in a great location across the street from the Palazzo with the other big hotels up and down the street.	4	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

Liked the free covered parking and general location on the strip. Typical casino set up. Room was clean but a bit small and no perks like free mini fridge/microwave etc. The one thing I really didn't like is the entire building had a strange smell- my guess is its some kind of deoderant to cover up smoking-but that alone would keep us from heading back.(We are non smokers). A smoker probably wouldn't mind this. The lobby area is crowded but staff were friendly. The free pirate show is worth seeing. We also saw the Circ show which was great ! Overall we had a positive experience but with so many competitors we plan to try a diff place next time.	4	5	-1	3	4	3	-1	4

The Treasure Island hotel is in a very good location, right in the heart of the Strip.<br/><br/>The quality of the hotel is very good but not the best. It is a 2nd generation category of Las Vegas hotels. These are the hotels that were built about 20 years ago and replaced the original old hotels. You will get a good value for the money, especially if you use the hotel only for overnight sleep and the buffet meals. If you want to stay in the latest hotels generation, these are the recently built hotels, you will pay more and you will get more luxury and ambiance - if that?? important for you. The Treasure Island has been well maintained with upgraded amenities such as flat screen TVs, Wi-Fi and room decorations.<br/><br/>To summarize: The Treasure island is a good choice if you want to save money, and stay in a very good area, and if you do not mind not having a super luxury hotel environment.	4	5	-1	4	5	3	-1	5

The room had a great strip view,2 bathrooms, one with jacuzzi and the other with shower, free mini fridge and safe. A king bed and a sofa bed. We were three in the room and we had plenty of space. If you book at Treasure, book a mini suite, it is worth it. The check in and check out was really fast, the walking distances to the elevators and the rooms just right and the location great. Just two things, whats the point of the resort fee? it felt like a way to charge you more for services that you dont use or need. And the pool is on the small side. But for me the real problem was the airconditioning. The room, the lobby, the whole hotel was too cold. We had to turn off the aircondition in our room to be able to sleep. It probably is a Vegas thing because the outside temperature was 40 degrees and inside was freezing. A sure way to get a cold.	5	4	-1	4	4	3	-1	3

I actually had to wait a few weeks to cool down before writing this so I wasn't as mad and used inappropriate language.<br/><br/>For some background, I have stayed multiple times at Ceasars, The Hotel at Mandalay Bay, MGM, Harrahs, Ballys, and Luxor prior to my trip at Treasure Island. And by far - hands down - Treasure Island was the worst Las Vegas experience I have ever had. We usually try to go to Vegas 1-2 times per year.<br/><br/>Positives: Rooms are not as badly decorated as I anticipated. Beds were very comfortable. Dealers and pit bosses are very friendly. Bar tenders are very nice and provide excellent service. Location is good and Mystere was a good show (not as good as Ka but worth the price of the discount tix at tix4tonight). <br/><br/>Negatives:<br/><br/>The rest of the staff are very unpleasant and I was a very polite customer the whole time so they must all really hate their jobs.<br/><br/>Based on other TA reviews I thought this would be a nice change but I was wrong. We stayed at TI for Labor Day weekend. Got in late Friday evening due to a flight delay and expected a long line as other reviewers mentioned, however, there were only about 3 other couples in line so I thought that was a good sign... wrong!<br/><br/>First off, other reviewers said if it is your birthday they send a bottle of champagne to your room. This trip was to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday which I mentioned that to the desk clerk who checked us in. She was rude and needless to say, no champagne was offered or sent. No big deal - I was able to get over this as I just figured it was worth a try asking. Another couple was also traveling with us - when they checked in their desk clerk offered them a bottle of champagne and they accepted but it was never delivered. Again - no big deal - as it was probably average champagne at best anyway.<br/><br/>They didn't have a king bed available so they told us we would have to have 2 queen beds. Again - no big deal - since our flight was delayed I figured the king rooms were probably already filled. <br/><br/>The cleaning crew was definitely below par - we were not given fresh towels after they took our old ones. Also, they did not restock the toilet paper or toiletries. <br/><br/>This is where I really got upset... When we signed up for the players card, the desk clerk told us that when we checked out to come by and see what comps we could get. I specifically asked that since my boyfriend and I lived together (same address) but had different last names, if they would combine our points and he said yes - just to give the desk clerk both cards. So, upon checkout, that is what we did. (Note: we are not small gamblers - not high rollers but definitely put a good chunk of money aside for our trips to Vegas to have fun and play - we play over $100 hands at the tables, slots, and horses at the sports book. And, we used our players card EVERY time we gambled.) The rude desk clerk told us that we didn't have enough points for any comps and that the next time we visited we could use our points for a breakfast... Our friends that were with us gambled 1/5th of what we did and they at least got a $25 comp whereas we were given nothing... NOTHING!!! When our friends did gamble, we were at the same table with them, were playing with more money and walked away in the hole and they were up. Now someone please explain that!?!?!?!?!<br/><br/>So my advice is not to waste your time, money, or vacation at Treasure Island unless you are fine with poor service and do not plan to gamble at all. I was highly disappointed and from now on will stay at my staples (Mandalay Bay or MGM) where I know I will be taken care of and have wonderful service. Their comps are much better - our last trip was at MGM and we gambled less than what we did this trip at TI and were given comps for meals, bar tabs, and 2 nights at MGM.	2	3	-1	2	2	1	-1	3

The hotel is nice, the rooms were clean and the bed was very comfy. If you can get an inexpensive room here, it's definitely worth the stay. However, it's a small casino and the restaurants are really lacking. We went to the buffet for breakfast one morning, NOT GOOD! It wasn't horrible, but I've had much better in Vegas. Overall, if you can get a good deal at one of the nicer places, go there, but if you can get a cheap room here, it's perfectly fine and I love that end of the strip, so it's a good location, IMO. One last thing, if you're in for a laugh, go see the Sirens of TI show...pretty funny.	3	4	-1	4	4	3	-1	4

I look for a good deal and go with it... While trying to mix it up and try some different spots. We like mid-strip so this is an excellent choice as far as location. There is a skywalk to the mall, close to most everything and parking garage is easy to get in and out of. I find that a major plus as some hotels send u through a mile long rat maze to find your car. Mid-strip is where it is at in my opinion. You dont need to play $100 hand bj nor do you need to subject yourself to the degenerates waiting to hit the big one at some of the off-strip places. The check-in was about 20 min which isn't bad for the strip. The buffet was pretty decent and a fairly good deal given the options in Las Vegas. The other restaurants are cool but a little spendy. Gilley's is a really cool bar/ restaurant somewhat coyote ugly style. Even the free pirate show out front was well-done. It had been years since I took the time to stand and watch it and I liked it. They have done a good job of making it more stripperish less Disney... Which I appreciate. Our room was really nice I thought... A little small but clean and nice view. Overall I think it is a good choice for mid- range type hotel on strip.	4	5	-1	4	5	5	-1	-1

Although I have stayed at a half dozen of the hotels there, by far my most common choice (over a dozen times to date) is Treasure Island, because of the staff service, the rooms, and the overall casino experience. It's been several years since I last stayed there but...Never again. A stay last month, in August, began badly and ended badly. The staff at the check-in desk were beyond rude and snarky, and while the room was nice enough, requests for toilet paper (one half roll on check in, for three people, not enough) and drinking glasses were ignored. Room service was slow, and despite repeated calls, trays and tables were not picked up until hours later, and the room service staff were as rude as the front desk folks were. Mystere, as always, was great, but with the exception of the one fabulous waitress we had at the Kahunaville restaurant, the hotel's club and other restaurant experiences ranged from poor to awful. The casino smelled awful, and event there, the usually perennially cheerful staff were notable by their absence. Check out - absolutely the worst person encountered on any trip ever was the sour, blatantly rude woman at the check out desk. Ignored my questions, griped about the length of time I took reading the hotel bill (wow, really! - there was no one in line behind me, and it's my money that was forked over to them...), and never once made eye contact. My plans for returning next year for an event with almost 3 dozen people will NOT include Treasure Island as originally envisioned - anywhere BUT Treasure Island. I'm not going to bother returning there again, regardless of the &quot;specials&quot;. What a colossal disappointment. What happened, Treasure Island???	4	4	-1	4	2	1	-1	3
UR118587444	7AA80BBFFBB620C8B6D7854F3D21A4EA	Treasure Island - TI Hotel & Casino	Las_Vegas_Nevada	2011-09-25	Do ANY of the employees EVER smile?	2	2	I am a regular visitor to Las Vegas. For the last six years, I have had the opportunity to travel to Las Vegas about once every 4 to 6 weeks. I have stayed everywhere on the Strip, so I know what to expect from most of them. I have been holding off on staying at TI again because the last time I stayed there (over 5 years ago), I was not really impressed. However, they have since done a refurbishment of their property and I received an invitation to come and stay for two nights at 50% off in a Tower Suite. I decided &quot;what the heck&quot;, so I booked the trip. <br/><br/>When I arrived on a Monday afternoon at about 3:30PM, the check-in lines were light. I went to the &quot;Invited Guest&quot; line and there was only one person in front of me. In the regular check-in line, there were about 20 people. I stood in the &quot;Invited Guest&quot; line for about 20 minutes while the person in front of me was doing God knows what! I noticed that the people I would have been behind (had I gone to the regular line) were now being helped, which means I actually slowed myself down by using the &quot;special&quot; line. Tip: Skip the special line unless you have some overwhelming desire to feel special, because it's not a special line at all. It was finally my turn, and I tipped the gentleman with a $50 bill to see if any upgrades were available for me. Keep in mind that I paid for and booked a Tower Suite in advance. The gentleman (I don't know his name, but he's an African American younger gentleman who is very overweight) said that he could &quot;bump me up&quot; to an Executive Suite. I said, &quot;Is this an upgrade?&quot;. He said, &quot;Oh yes, this is a huge upgrade&quot;. For some reason, I did not think this was the case because I remember when I originally booked my trip online, I looked at the differences between the various suites and I seemed to remember that the Tower Suite was bigger and more expensive than the Executive Suite. But he promised me I was getting quite an upgrade, so I said &quot;okay&quot;. It turns out, this was actually a downgrade. After I checked into the room, I went to TI's website and saw that the square footage of my &quot;upgraded&quot; suite was smaller than the Tower Suite that I originally booked. I don't mind if I tip someone at the check-in counter and they are not able to find anything for me, because in those cases, they just say, &quot;I'm sorry but we are overbooked today&quot; (or something) and hand my money back to me. But this gentleman pulled a fast one on me. He took the 50 bucks I gave him, and then tried to get me to think that he was doing me a favor, when in fact, he literally downgraded me. I was not a happy camper once I discovered this. But I decided to just blow it off, and I'm going to have a good time anyway. <br/><br/>By the way, I have attached pictures of the &quot;Executive Suite&quot; to this review. It's pretty pathetic. I have stayed in lots of suites on the Strip, and this is by far the worst. It is teeny-tiny, and the flat screen TV's DO NOT receive HD signals. So if you are like me and you enjoy watching your programs in HD, forget about it at TI---they just don't offer it. Even if they did, the flat screens are the smallest on the Strip. My guess is that they are 26 inches which is incredibly small. Their channel lineup leaves a lot to be desired as well. Just expect the regular local channels, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, Chinese, Spanish, and the hotel channels---that's about it. <br/><br/>The one thing that struck me over and over again while I was at this hotel for four days was the simple fact that EVERY employee at TI really seemed to hate their jobs. I don't mean they were bored with their jobs. I mean they HATED their jobs. I've never seen anything like it----ever. At first I thought it was a fluke, but as I began to pay more and more attention, I actually started to say &quot;wow&quot; to myself every time I walked by an employee who looked like they were either about to fall asleep or just wanted to be put out of their misery. It was the strangest thing I'd ever seen. And I know this was not my imagination because I would walk over to Venetian/Palazzo, Wynn/Encore, and Mirage, and in all of those properties I experienced happy employees who SMILED and who greeted me with a simple, &quot;Hello, how are you?&quot;. I'm not talking about the gaming area---I'm talking about the restaurants, the shops, the attractions, etc...TI has the sorriest looking group of employees I have ever witnessed. As part of staying there, you are required to pay a daily &quot;resort fee&quot; of roughly 20 bucks or so. Included in this resort fee is a daily USA Today newspaper which is available at the Guest Services counter. On my first morning there (Tuesday the 20th), after waking up in the room and getting cleaned up, I walked downstairs to grab a paper from Guest Services and it was no problem. There were two stacks of USA Today sitting on the counter. So I just picked one up, and walked away to go eat at the buffet. My next morning (Wednesday) at about 10:30AM, the check-in area and the Guest Services counter were VERY crowded with people standing in line. I should mention that of course I passed by a number of employees who were, as usual, wearing their frowns and acted like they had no desire to be there. When I got to the Guest Services counter and saw that there were at least 20 people in line (and only ONE frowning employee behind the counter), I decided to say nicely, &quot;Excuse me, are you all out of the USA Today paper for hotel guests?&quot;. She snapped her head around, looked at me, and said, &quot;GET. IN. LIIIIIIINE.&quot; When she said that to me, I almost thought it was a joke, but I quickly realized that she wasn't joking. I turned around and left. Why should I stand in a line that is 20 people deep (which would probably take an hour to go through) just to get a paper? So I walked around the corner to the hotel's gift shop and I said, &quot;Do you have the morning paper here?&quot;, and a frowning woman pointed (without speaking) to a stack of papers. I picked up the USA Today and I said, &quot;If I show you my room key and ID, can I get this paper for free because the line at Guest Services is 20 people deep and the woman there made me get to the back of the line just for a paper that is supposed to be part of my resort fee&quot;. Frowning employee #76 said, &quot;We don't give papers away for free&quot;. Oh boy.....I am now realizing how much I'm starting to hate this hotel. So I paid the $1 and got my &quot;free&quot; USA Today, and walked over to the buffet (which closes for breakfast at 11AM and it was coming up on 10:45AM by now). <br/><br/>The buffet....ugh.....Here is what you should know. You are there at TI on a &quot;deal&quot;--right? Well guess what? So is everybody else. Buy one/get one free buffet coupons seem to be handed out to everyone who checks into the hotel, so that means there will be longggggggggggg lines at the buffet. And even though they REFUSE to tell you this, I will tell you now: The buffet pass that they give you is only good for Monday through Friday, lunch and dinner only (not breakfast and not Sunday brunch). That's right! Don't say I didn't warn you. Once I was seated in the buffet, I went to one area where I saw a sign that said &quot;Grits&quot;, but something else was in it's place. I asked the frowning employee behind the counter, &quot;Do you have grits?&quot;, and she said, &quot;Yeah, hang on&quot; and then she went and got a huge bucket of them out of the back room. I told her that the &quot;grits&quot; sign is still here on the buffet and I asked why she had to go to the back to get them? She said, &quot;We're tearing down breakfast now and putting lunch up&quot;. I said, &quot;I thought breakfast was until 11AM?&quot;. No answer. Just more frowning and the look of &quot;I hate my job&quot;. So I suppose this is another tip for those reading this review---If you want to eat breakfast at the buffet, even though they're supposed to serve until 11AM, it looks to me like they begin tearing town and taking away all of the breakfast foods around 10:30AM. Why? I have no idea. <br/><br/>The whole resort in general can be summed up in a few simple ways: First and foremost, they have the most unfriendly and unhelpful employees around. I went to buy a bottle of water from the gift shop and there were about 7 people in front of me (also buying water and other snacks). The Filipino woman who worked there on Wednesday evening at around 8PM was about as slow as they come. Pick up a bottle of water. Look for the hand held scanning device. Find the scanning device. Pick up the scanning device. Try to aim scanning device at bar code on water bottle. Where is bar code? Put down scanning device. Hold water bottle with two hands. Ah, there is the bar code. Put water bottle down. Pick scanning device up. Now, where was that bar code? Oh, there it is. Scan the barcode. (Now there are 10 people waiting in line, all probably saying to themselves, &quot;IT'S JUST A BOTTLE OF WATER!!! COME ON ALREADY!!!!!!&quot;). Pick up bottle of water again. Say, &quot;That will be one dollar&quot;. Put down bottle of water. Ever so s l o w l y reach across towards the customer to retrieve the one dollar bill for the water. Ah---you got it! Now, take that dollar bill and press a whole bunch of buttons---very slowly---on the cash register. (Now there are 13 people in line). Through some sort of combination of luck and magic, the cash drawer opens. Reach inside and place the dollar bill in the drawer. Slowly close drawer. Then ever so slowly, reach for the $1 receipt and say, &quot;Would you like a receipt for your bottle of water?&quot;. Customer says no (and customer is thinking, &quot;I just want to get the heck out of here!&quot;). Employee looks for place to put receipt that customer did not want. (Now there are 17 people in line). You get the picture--I hope! It was SO frustrating trying to deal with people in this store. If you think you're going to run in and buy a water and run out, FORGET IT--NOT GONNA HAPPEN. They have no clue how to accomplish anything even remotely close to that. My advice: Walk past the hotel's gift shop and walk towards the &quot;Mystere&quot; theater, go past it, now go up the escalator like you're heading towards the tram that takes you to Mirage but go past it, then on your right you will see another small gift shop (the one where they sell Krispy Kreme doughnuts). The person who works in there knows how to work a cash register. You can actually walk in, grab a water from the fridge, pay, and walk out---all in under 30 seconds. You are DOOMED if you try the hotel gift shop. You are guaranteed to be in there for at least 20 minutes and you might even walk out with an ulcer in your stomach from the extreme frustration of watching them try to figure out how to sell water. <br/><br/>A few notes about the resort itself: The rooms do not have mini-bars, so you will have to bring up your own snacks, water bottles, sodas, etc....My suggestion is to NOT go to the hotel's gift shop, but instead do as I mentioned above (go to where they sell the Krispy Kreme doughnuts). Yes, it's a longer walk. But you can just zip in, pick up your snacks and drinks, and zip out. You can have fun doing this by watching someone in the gift shop, because when you come back and you're heading to the elevators, you will see the same person at the counter STILL trying to pay for their items! And even though I mentioned this one before, I think it's worth repeating again: The TV's in the rooms are flat screen but they are NOT high definition. They're just regular definition (and the TV's are old, with crappy audio). TI's website says that all of their suites have AM/FM radios with mp3 plug-ins. This is not true. At least, this is not true for the room I stayed in which was 26-038. I had a Bose AM/FM radio, and there was no way to connect an mp3 player to it. What they SHOULD have are those &quot;iHome&quot; clock radios that most hotels have these days, where you can place your iPod directly on top. I don't know why they advertise that you can use your mp3 player in your suite, but this simply was not the case with me (which is a shame, as I use my iPod Touch for everything when I travel--including for wake up music). <br/><br/>I think they advertise this hotel to be a 4 star. It is not. This is a 3 star hotel. If you want to see a 4 star hotel, walk over to Mirage and you will immediately see the difference. TI is sort of like the &quot;Wal Mart&quot; of the Strip hotels. There are lots of pregnant mom's carrying around screaming kids while the dad (?) is all covered in tattoos and is drunk and smoking as they somehow try to schlop through the corridors. An easy way to see the difference between a &quot;nice&quot; hotel on the Strip and a &quot;not so nice&quot; hotel on Strip is to do something very easy. Just take a walk through Wynn (across the street), or Palazzo, or Venetian. Now walk through TI. See the difference? Yeah, I thought so. <br/><br/>A &quot;4 star&quot; hotel would not allow the common area carpets to get filthy, as they do at TI. For an example (if someone at TI management is reading this), go and look at the carpeting outside the elevators on the 26th floor. Look at those carpets, now follow it around to the center area where the 3 corridors meet. FILTHY!! I'll bet you haven't had those carpets shampooed since April. In a true 4 star hotel, this would not happen. In a 5+ star property (such as Wynn), they shampoo their carpets 7 nights per week---their carpets are ALWAYS clean. At TI, it was disgusting. <br/><br/>I definitely feel like I did not get the value for the money I paid to stay there. My bill came to over $600 for 3 nights (WOW!) and I am a single traveler. If the employees would at least smile and say &quot;Good morning&quot;, or &quot;Hello, how are you doing?&quot;, it would make all the difference in the world. But I would swear that every single employee in this place REALLY hates their job because they mope around all day, and their priority seems to NEVER be to help the people who are paying to stay there. I don't know if TI's blackjack dealers were friendly or not because I purposely avoided them. With all of the sour faces I was seeing, that was enough. I walked across to Wynn and played at the $100 table for a total of about 14 hours on this trip. I would have liked to have played at TI, but I just did not want to go through all of the other stuff I had gone through. I've left so many things out, but these are the highlights and I hope this is helpful to those of you who are looking for a place to stay in Vegas. My recommendation is to stay at Mirage if you're looking to pay about the same as TI. The employees are friendly, the rooms are nicer, and the pool is fantastic! If you want to spend a little bit more, go across the street to Wynn or Encore--you can't lose! I would say that you should only stay at TI if it was your last choice and nothing else was available. <br/><br/>Oh--I almost forgot. The beds at TI, strangely enough, were very comfortable. I wanted to buy a bed to have it delivered to my home. I stopped by the gift shop and when I asked about their beds, I was met with a look like I was from a different planet. I said, &quot;Your beds. You know, the things that people sleep on. Most hotels sell them these days&quot;. He said oh, oh, yes, we sell the beds. Great, can you please tell me how much? This is where it gets good: I can ONLY speak with someone named Ruby, and she won't be in until tomorrow after 9AM. Hah hah hah!!! I said well, that's tough luck, because my flight home is tonight. I mean REALLY??? Can't they at least have some pamphlets sitting out that a customer can pick up and learn about their beds???? This hotel works REALLY REALLY hard at making sure you will never be their customer again. I've never experienced anything like it. Buyer Beware!	2	5	-1	2	4	2	-1	4

This hotel can be pricey if you don?? check for good deals in their website. Anyway, i really didn?? know what to expect, even though most of the reviews here are good and they were very helpful when making a decision. <br/>A lot of people complain about the location of the hotel, which i think was good enough, when you go to Las Vegas you know you will be walking a lot, no matter where you stay. I really liked this hotel for one important reason: it is &quot;small&quot;. When i say small i mean you can go around it without getting lost like in other huge, i mean HUGE hotels in Las Vegas, i.e. the Caesars, MGM, Mirage... and for that reason the distances you have to walk within the hotel are reasonable. Besides, their main floor plan is really easy to understand.<br/>When we got there around 4 in the afternoon, there were no lines in the Lobby, which was great. When we booked the room we didn?? make any special request, but when we were at the reception desk, the girl asked us whether we wanted double beds or king, smoking-non smoking, which i thought was nice instead of just giving us whatever she wanted. I even asked her if it was possible to get one of the top floors, and she got it for us. I would really recommend getting one of these rooms, maybe from floor 25th up. The show of Sirens is every hour and a half, and it can be really loud, although who is sleeping in Las Vegas at 11:30pm when the last show starts? We were at the 31st floor, our room facing the Palazzo, and we could hear everything from the show below, the music, the dialogues and of course, the fireworks. We weren?? bothered at all, but i guess it is better to be as up as possible. I actually requested it in order to get a view, no matter if it was the Strip or the Mountains but if you want to avoid the loudness of the show, be sure to request a room that is not facing the Siren's Cove, but ey! we enjoyed it, i think it was part of the feeling of being in Las Vegas!<br/><br/>The room was very clean and spacious, as well as the bathroom. We kept hanging our towels to &quot;recycle&quot; them but the maid kept leaving clean ones every day. In this trip we were camping everywhere else, but in Las Vegas we decided to give TI a try, and we were so satisfied! <br/><br/>The only minus: The Buffet. It wasn?? what i was expecting. And even though we got it for free as a part of the deal, we could have done without it. We had dinner at La Isla, and we enjoyed it very much, the service was excellent.<br/><br/>So if you are heading to Vegas, consider TI as an option, even though it is not as luxurious as its neighbors The Venetian and The Palazzo, TI is very nice, comfortable, clean and very convenient. Bring good walking shoes, and use them the very first day or you'll regret it!!!! Happy trip!	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

We just got back and here is what you need to know about the TI as likes to be called now. <br/><br/>Location<br/><br/>I didn't think I would like this location at the end of the strip but man was I proved wrong. There are several convenient pedestrian bridges which give you direct access to the Fashion Show mall and the Venetian, which will easily take you across the way to the Wynn hotel. What I found very convenient is the Walgreens located in the Venetian at ground level. We hopped in there often for snacks and bottles of water. The Mirage hotel is connected to the TI with a monorail which runs almost 24/7 and made the walk down to Ceasars Palace and the Forum shops really easy.<br/><br/>Rooms<br/><br/>I know a lot of people rave about the beds and I'm going to do it as well. The rooms are renovated really elegantly. Very modern, clean and organized the beds are super comfortable. After a long day of walking and night of partying you will sink into the beds and forget you are in Vegas. We slept really well.<br/><br/>Dining &amp; Entertainment<br/>Nothing at TI impressed us. The new skanky Sirens club (some sort of Cowboy Hooters) was not for us girls. Kahunaville is ok fun but pretty dead when we went. The staff were fun and we had a really good time. We also saw Mystere and thought it was really fun. Very awesome to just head down from the room to catch the show. <br/><br/>We didn't gamble or hang much at the hotel but it was so close to Wynn and Venetian and our favourite hangouts Tryst and Tao that we didn't care. This was great value on the strip and I would recommend it to everyone.	5	4	-1	5	4	3	-1	5

It is now a place where you ave 21 yr old books in with 4 pax in a twin room and just drinks all day. The general luggage coming through the door is a plastic bag with 24 beers in it and there is no management prescence at all!<br/><br/>I did try and complain twice but to no avail and did not even dare venture to the pool as it was an absolute mess!<br/><br/>It is not kid friendly at all and since being sold by mirage it has just destroyed itself. The resort fee is also a joke because everything is 2 for 1 like the buffet so as a single traveller- they can't be utilized - so in essence I got my boarding passes printed and Internet at $22.40 a day!<br/><br/>Staff were very rude in general and in fact in the buffet restaurant I did not have 1 plate cleared during my 2 meals!!<br/><br/>The position is also average with most things happening around the other hotels.<br/><br/><br/>I will not go back and will certainly not recommend it-	1	3	-1	3	1	1	-1	3

The hotel rooms were decent enough, and we got bumped up to the top floor upon arriving. Not much difference except for higher ceilings in the room, and you also need to use your room key to access the floor.<br/><br/>The casino itself is nothing special, but it did have lower minimums, so very affordable if you're gambling. The weekend we were there, the tables weren't packed, and you could basically just walk up to any table and get in on the action. Also, there appeared to be many tables empty, with bored dealers waiting for any action.<br/><br/>The location of the hotel is great as it's located close to shopping, other great casinos, and great nightclubs. Didn't check out the TI clubs, but passing by it looked like it was good. The pool seemed decent enough, with a rowdy college sophomore vibe - so if that's your thing, TI might be the place for you.	5	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	5

I'm thankful we didn't as I may have been a little nervous. Instead, I entered without any preconceived thoughts and found my stay at TI to be a very solid experience.<br/><br/>Parking was easy and free and the 3rd floor walkway to the hotel was easy to find. <br/><br/>From there we went to check in, and the line was packed. Thanks to quick thinking friends, half of our party stood in line and the other half went to get us a cocktail. We finished it while approaching the desk so the timing was perfect - maybe 20-25 minutes. The gentleman at the desk was friendly, even when I asked him to repeat through my rumpled snorting nose that the $22.50 &quot;resort fee&quot; was mandatory. While I intended to come across as appalled, I think it may have just looked like a tick. He took pity and upgraded us to a room overlooking the strip and the show.<br/><br/>From there we hightailed it through the casino perimeter and the smell of smoke is pretty strong, a little stronger than I find it to be at other casinos. It appears to be a little smaller and older than the other bigger casinos, but we found the floor staff to be friendly and attentive, and the machines, tables, and chairs seem to be in good condition and relatively updated.<br/><br/>The cleanliness of the room was very good and the view from the 28th floor was great. A few notes in that there were only 3 towels for four people, no coffee maker, and no bed skirts. Because they have a Starbuck's I probably wouldn't have used the coffee pot anyway, so no points off. The towels were just an oversight and also no points off. But the lack of bedskirt was well, odd. There was the box spring sticking out in all of its glory. 1/2 point off for giving me a flashback to my 20's when I could only afford places that eliminated the bedskirt issue by only having one mattress. But it was clean and enough room for four, so we dropped our bag and headed out.<br/><br/>We took the tram over to the Mirage and caught the Love show of Cirqu du Soleil. From there we hung out, strolled across to the Venetian and around the Strip. TI is in a great location and we were able to hit the main spots of the strip that we wanted within 3-4 blocks.<br/><br/>Most of our meals were taken at TI, which we found to be slightly pricer than the quality warranted, but it is Vegas. One exception is the Vietnamese restaurant (The PHO, I think) which was tasty, good value, and our service was exceptional.<br/><br/>While we found the other hotel restaurants to be slightly high $, the shopping wasn't outrageous in price and we did pick up a few mementos. Overall, the entire staff were friendly and accomodating and it was easy to mauever through the hotel/casino, as well as access to the Strip.<br/><br/>The pool was clean and seating available on a Sunday morning. We liked the checkout time of noon and would definitely not hesitate to recommend TI, just know you are going to spend $13.00 for two latte's at Starbucks. Crikey. But I advise a quick walk to the Walgreen's across the street to get the basics - chocolate, water, aspirin, etc.	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	5

As other TA fellows noticed, there is a long line to check in: I got there at 4.30 pm and had to queue for about 30 minutes to register. We had parked our car in the huge covered parking lot behind the hotel and we had to carry of our bags by ourselves to our room because the porter service only operates from the front entrance and there are no carts available either.<br/>On the good side, Treasure Island is centrally located on the strip and has walkways that easily take you to the Fashion Mall (we tried the food court there but weren't satisfied with the quality of food) and to the Palazzo (where you can find a Walgreens). A real plus was the Strip view room: during the day we faced San Marco Square at the Venetian and at night we could see the enlighted fountains at the Bellagio and the volcano at the Mirage from our room. By the way, a free tram connects Treasure Island to the Mirage: one night we took it to go to the latter for dinner and we were completely satisfied with the food choices there and the tropical ambiance. And the casino at Mirage did not stink of smoke either!<br/>Another plus was that it hosts Mystere by Cirque du Soleil: what a great show! I do recommend to anyone staying here to go and see it, you won't regret it! I had booked months in advance but there were actually quite a few seats still available for the same date. On the first floor of the Fashion Mall (streetside) there is a booth selling half price tickets for several shows and dinners in LV and they also had Mystere listed, you might try there first.	4	4	-1	4	2	3	-1	-1

There was no need, check in and out was a breeze. The staff were excellent, friendly and professional. We booked a Tower suite with an attached deluxe room for the kids. Would highly recommend this to everyone. The price was excellent for the room. I also loved the dedicated lifts. They are not kidding the beds are the best I want one.<br/>Treasure island isn't completely central, but is in an excellent position. The casino isn't the biggest, but big enough and great fun. We played at other casinos and TI drinks waitress came around more often and if you did buy drinks they were cheaper than most. We ate at the Mexican, the Italian, the Coffee shop, and canters deli. All good,especially the Italian. The pool could be bigger, but It was good enough and the kids enjoyed it. It was crowded while the DJ played, but had a fun atmosphere. After the DJ left and during the week days the pool had plenty of room.<br/>The sirens show is OK but I would bother again, the fountains and volcano shows are better.<br/>The only disappointment was that Mystere wasn't on for the week we were there,and I really wanted to see it.<br/>The kids and I did the 1 day White Water Rafting trip at the Grand Canyon, would highly recommend it. Not cheap, but worth every cent.<br/>We had a great time at the TI and will be back.	4	4	-1	5	4	4	-1	5

I was pleasantly surprised by the rooms. They were clean and newly remodeled. I'm very picky when it comes to cleanliness and it passed the test.<br/>Service at the front desk was so so. No one was rude, but they weren't exactly friendly. (The maid service was friendly.)<br/>I just wish it was located more towards the middle of the strip, but what can you do?<br/>Also, the resort fee pisses me off.

The express bus is nicer than the local Deuce which stops at practially all the stops and gets very crowded. We had a TV ad deal, so for the price, it was a good value. <br/><br/>We didn't have to wait too long to check-in but unfortunately we didn't get a strip view room and they didn't have any king beds left, so we had two queen beds. We felt the closet was a bit small, but there was ample drawer space. Our view was of the west, so we saw Trump Tower, the side of Fashion Show Mall and in the distance the mountain in Red Rock Canyon. There was no refrigerator or coffee maker in our room and to get a cup of basic brewed coffee at the bar just opposite the Coffee Shop was 2.50. Yes, there is a Starbucks in the hotel as well as just outside as you exit to the sidewalk. I thought the room was furnished nice enough, but felt that the carpet was looking worn and dirty. The maid service was all right. I felt that the bathrooms were never cleaned well and the tub area needed to be redone. The towels were also a bit scratchy and the bath mat seemed small for the tub area. On the plus side the tub as a good sized soaking tub. The beds were very comfortable. <br/><br/>The gambling there was alright. The siren show was very corny. We tried the buffet because we had a 2 for 1 coupon. It was all right. The brisket; pasta station and dessert station was probably the best part. We also had a light breakfast at the Coffee Shop on the morning we were leaving. It was fair. Check-out had quite a line, but we were told that all we needed to do was drop our keys in key drop. Overall for the price it was a good value and we would stay there again.	4	3	-1	3	2	3	-1	4

We decided this year to book somewhere further north along Las Vegas Boulevard and also to treat ourselves with a Tower Suite. <br/>Upon arriving at TI, we found that what we had read before hand was true. The check in queue was enormous! There were 6 members of staff behind the desk and only 4 of them were checking people in. They were also taking quite a few minutes in between each check in to do some paper work. After spending almost 11 hours on a plane all we wanted was a shower, this was finally possible an hour after arriving at the hotel. <br/>The Tower Suite we had booked was nicely furnished with both bathrooms being of a decent size. The downside was that the rooms did not appear to have had much of a clean since the last guests. We found a couple of used drinks caps on the floor around the bed along with a phone charger and a pair of socks in the dressing room. We don't tend to spend too much time in our hotel room when we are in Las Vegas so we could put up with the housekeeping as the bedding and bathrooms were clean. In addition, there seemed to be little soundproofing in the windows. It wasn't something we thought might be an issue when choosing a strip view room as in other hotels you don't tend to hear anything; however, at TI, we were surprised to hear a lot of the outside noise made it's way into the room at night. This is not a hotel we will be staying at again.	3	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	2

For the money, the hotel is a great deal. The rooms are very nicely laid out and a good size, furnishings are contemporary, beds and bedding very comfortable and clean and all fixtures and furnishings etc are fairly new (I believe the hotel was renovated in 2010). The casino is quite large and anyone wanting to gamble will find what they need. The hotel also features an outdoor pool with hot tub, many different restaurants including the buffet which we used often and houses the Cirque du Soleil show, Mystere. The staff at the hotel were helpful and friendly and our overall experience at this hotel was very positive. If you are not familiar with the layout of Las Vegas, the Treasure Island hotel is located across from the Venetian and Palazzo and is right next door to the Mirage, which features a nightly volcano show which is well worth seeing. Be sure also to watch the Sirens of Treasure Island show as well, nightly outdoors on the Las Vegas Blvd. side of the hotel.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

It was out second trip to Vegas this year and first time we stayed at Signature at MGM.<br/><br/>The location of TI is pretty good: there is a pharmacy and the mall around. The room was fine, even though in need of some renovations. The chack in was quite long (mostly because of the travvelers), but not the end of world. However, the major problem of the TI is the pool! It is small, stinky and VERY durty. On the weekend, the is VERY loud music, a whole buch of drunk people dansing in the pool with their drinks and all.You can't really chill by the pool since the music is so loud or really swim in it, as it is very small and busy!<br/><br/>We ended up going to Ceasar's Palace pools (free for ladies Mon-Friday, otherwise 20$), which was sooo worth it! <br/><br/>If you are going in the summer months and the pool is quite important for you, do not stay in the TI. If price is comparable to other hotels on the Stip, don't go to TI, unless it's a great deal,<br/><br/>Overall, I would not stay here again or recommend to friends.

It wasn't bad!<br/><br/>The goods: Comfy bed, good location, smaller hotel where you dont get lost trying to find your room. I liked the vanity mirror in the bathroom as well, that was nice!<br/><br/>Not as good: Kahunaville's dinner food was not great at all, and very overpriced (all though it seems all of the restaurants were overpriced) and the service was just kinda blah... When we got there I expected something neat when they dimmed the lights (something more along the lines of Rainforest Cafe) and it was just a dinky water show... Pool was pretty tiny and pretty gross with only people getting drunk in it all day, and we were charged the resort fee AND the internet charges every day... Luckily I noticed it just as we were about to get in a taxi and was able to run back to the desk and get it fixed up. <br/><br/>Location wise, the Walgreens across the street was perfect, and Venetian/ Mirage were really close with lots to do there. We gambled a fair bit at Venetians the first couple days and won way more there than we did the next 2 days at TI.<br/><br/>We're heading back in November and I'm looking forward to checking out the mall over the walkway, see if they have any better (and cheaper!!) lunch options...

The room was very nice and clean with comfortable beds, relatively quiet. We ate at the buffet although we normally avoid these places (were given coupons when checked in) the food was ok, if I was paying I wouldn't eat there, not good value for the cost. Unless you want to do the quick checkout be prepared to wait, there was only one available person to check out guests, she did a great job but she could have used some help.

TI worked out to be a good choice since it provided all of the amenities neccessary for a wonderful time. We were located one of the top floors with views of the strip. Check in went smooth with just a short wait, frontdesk personnel were friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean,however, carpets are starting to show some age. Bathroom was clean, towels could have been a little softer. All in all the rooms were good value for the money.<br/>We had a great time in the casino, with the only complaint being that as the evenings wore on and the casino became busyer the ventilation did not seem to clear the air of the relatively heavy cigarette smoke which was bothersome. We visited other hotels later in the evenings and did not notice this same occurance. I've noticed that many have complained about the daily &quot;resort fee&quot;,since most of our time gambling was spent at TI, we werefortunate to have had some winnings and accrued enough players club points to have these fees compted along with some meals etc. The casino staff seemed pretty obliging with the comps.<br/>Now for a couple of things that could use some attention. Since we had free buffet vouchers as a part of our package we ate there our first night, like many buffets there were many choices, a lot of food, with mediocre quality. The best bet is the dessert section!. Since we had tickets to the early Mystere show (an entertaining show I might add) we decided to eat at Phil's Italian Steakhouse. This was a real disappointment! Way over priced especially for the quality, have had better steaks at Outback for about one quarter the price. If you are up for a good steak, there are many better recommendations available. As far as room amenities are concerned, it would have been nice to have coffee service in the room. <br/>All in all we had a great time and had a comfortable stay and would return here at TI again, we would just have our meals elsewhere mobility challenges dictated that we stay within the hotel for our meals.	3	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	-1

It's not the nicest hotel on the strip by a long shot, but the hotel itself is well located and it's very good for its budget class. We figured that we were far better off getting a less expensive room than the Wynn or the Bellagio (both in very easy walking distance) and spending the extra money on food, fun and games.<br/><br/>The rooms are adequate: nicely decorated, if plain.

Having read the mixed reviews on tripadvisor, we were a little concerned. We drove in from LA and arrived at about 5 pm. Located across the street form the Fashion Show Mall and has a walkway to it. Yes, the wait to check in was long (about an hour) and the lobby was crowded. Check in staff was friendly. Rooms were fine. (We made reservations through priceline.com for $99/nt.) No complaints about our stay at the TI except that we tried two nights in a row to catch the Sirens of TI show and both times it was cancelled. The first time, we were told it was too windy, and to be honest, it was. The next night, they used the same excuse, but it was not windy at all. We played at the &quot;Gilley Girls&quot; pits. (That was a lot more fun than playing at the regular tables. However, they do close early Sun-Thurs.) Best food deal at TI was Canter's Deli, located at the back of the hotel, near the sport book area. Food was worth the money (as opposed to the over priced buffet), and prices were reasonable. <br/> While in Vegas, we ate at:<br/>Ellis Island Casino (down the block and over one block) - which, I was told, is where the locals eat (steak and eggs breakfast for $4.99 pp). Service was friendly and the food was good. Decor reminded me of &quot;old Las Vegas&quot;; great atmosphere.<br/>Serendipity 3 (on the Strip) - hubby and I had to wait about 15-20 minutes even though it was 3:30 pm (very late lunch/very early dinner). We shared an order of Kobe beef sliders with sweet potato fries and a very large frozen hot chocolate. Food was good. However, our friends, who came in as we were leaving, ordered the same thing but their food came out cold. They were very disappointed.<br/>Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill (located in Caesars Palace) - Food and service was awesome! Of course, the prices were high, but what do you expect? It's Bobby Flay!<br/> Check out from TI was fine. We did it on the tv. No problems.	3	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

We very much enjoyed our stay at TI and would definitely stay there again. We found the hotel to be in a perfect location, in the center of the Las Vegas strip, next to the Mirage hotel and Fashion Mall. We booked a rate online and by signing their Guestbook was able to get a very discounted rate. Our room on the 24th floor was great, the room was extremely clean, the bathroom and towels were perfectly clean. I think it had been recently refurbished and it looked new. We had a view of the strip. The beds were awesome and so comfortable. We found the staff to be very courteous and helpful. The only downside we saw was that the casino needs to be refurbished. The casino at TI in no way matches up to some of the elegant casinos at Bellagio, Venitian, or other high end hotels. The dealers were not dressed very well. It didn't feel very classy. But, overall I give TI five stars because we got a great room rate, the location of the hotel, and the room was very nice and clean! It was a great value and we will definitely stay there again next year.	5	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

Check in was easy though it probably helped that we arrived at 6pm on a monday night. I asked what room we were allocated and was told none yet, was asked what I would like and was granted my request of a King size bed with a strip view. Better than that we were given a panoramic view.<br/><br/>Rooms very nice for the price paid and bed very comfortable. TV choice isnt great mind though I pod docking station a nice touch.<br/><br/>The pool is nice and clean with good service and towels provided. Very busy as youd expect over the weekend with a good party atmosphere. <br/><br/>The buffet is ok, though much better for breakfast than lunch I Thought. Canters do nice sarnies that appear overpriced until served,they're huge (maybe thats english naivety).<br/><br/>All in all very happy with experience at TI	5	5	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

Shower/tub nice size and clean. <br/><br/>The Bell Desk was helpful getting my dads scooter taken care of. <br/><br/>The only draw back is the resort fee, but I needed internet so I guess it was a wash.	4	5	-1	4	5	5	-1	5

The hotel is not as nice as it used to be. The rooms are clean but showing wear. The towels were so thin and thread bare, the sheets were old, and the bedding showed age. The Players club manager was rude and not at all friendly. He could not find my card info from my previous stay and proceeded to grill me that i never had a card in the first place. Not at all how you should treat a returning guest. There are plenty of other nice places to stay and i will try another hotel on my next trip to Vegas...	2	3	-1	2	3	1	-1	3

However if you have to deal with anyone in the casino, front desk, casino host GOOD LUCK! There is no communcation between the casino hosts and the casino itself. Every person you talk to tells you a different story so get it in writing if its anything with repect to what you will be comped for or charged. Service was no where near where it was the first time we stayed. Other casinos told us since the TI was sold recently the service has really gone down hill - I'm not sure about the sale part but I am about the service part. The casino workers are like zombies, very hard to get a drink (like 45-60mins waiting on 1 machine), just not a happy vibe going on. I was embarrassed as I had previously raved about the hotel from our previous stay, we had another couple travelling with us who were wanting to stay elsewhere but we pushed TI. Not somewhere I would recommend if you want to enjoy the hotel, food or gamble - there is much better out there, better comp offers etc.. I tried to fill out the survey on our TV upon check out, but of course it wouldnt work, our tv didnt work well much of our 6 night stay - we were sick of having a tech coming to our room so we gave up. We were dissappointed to say the least, felt worse for our travel companions as we had recommended. The last couple of nights we gambled elsewhere.	-1	3	-1	3	3	1	-1	3

The hotel has had a bit of a makeover with a new Gilleys western-style bar and diner featuring beautiful cowgirl waitresses in skimpy outfits and a bucking bull which looked like great fun, they had line dancing lessons and music acts on several nights. great fun - loved it. There's also now a new bar called Sirens Sip where you can watch the galleons fighting (formerly Buccaneer Bay) based on Greek legend theme. The buffets OK too, so all round we had a good time. But! the pool area has caught the noise bug! We used to stay at the Hotel Monte Carlo until one year they started belting out 'music' at full pitch around the pool. Now I love music -any sort from Mozart to Heavy Metal but this crap was just Crap Rap. ear-shattering &quot;Yo momma you momma you motherf...ing momma&quot; Now that aint music it's just noise and painful noise at that. Everyone complained but they never turned it down so we checked out and went to the the TI. So were were very disappointed and a bit annoyed to find that instead of an idyllic palm-fringed tropical paradise poolside that we previously enjoyed the place is now vibrating to the strains of ~yo momma&quot; too. Too loud, so loud your ears bleed and they even had their own DJ - known as DJ Serious~who was a DJ who seriously lacked any musical taste whatsoever. It was hell - and I repeat my wife I love all sorts of music and find it really relaxing - but when it's too load (and again everyone was complaining - after all the majority of guests were not 16 year-old kids from the 'hood' they were ordinary holidaymakers. So no we won't be going back to the TI again. Sorry but like the Monte Carlo the management of these hotels just never learn to satisfy their core client base, they just cave in to the demands of the 'yoof market' Half wits.Entertainment we enjoyed were Donny and Marie, Vinny Favorito (very un-Politically Correct) and a couple of trips to the Comedy Store for some very funny stand up - always good value. Couldn't get tickets for Rod Stewart.	4	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

As others have said, check in was long but we were expecting that so no biggie. They were able to get all 4 couples on the 36th floor which was great. The room was very nice (beds absolutely incredibly comfortable!). The bathroom did show some wear and tear but nothing terrible. The water pressure in the shower and sink was quite poor, but again, nothing to ruin a trip.<br/><br/>We ate at the buffet as well as breakfast at Margueritaville and lunch at Gilly's all were quite good although pretty pricey. Gilly's at night was very slow while we were there and the drinks were ridiculously expensive.<br/><br/>We all liked the casino quite a bit and found the service very good. Compared to my last stay at Monte Carlo we received drinks much faster and found everyone extremely friendly.<br/><br/>The location of the hotel is great, especially f you are a shopper or use the bus. The bus stops right outside of the Fashion Show mall and also across the street at the Palazzo which was very handy. If you are on a bit of a budget there is a food court at the Fashion Show mall which was nice to pick up a quick sandwich or bagel instead of an expensive restaurant meal.<br/><br/>This was my 2nd trip to Vegas (as mentioned, first time stayed at Monte Carlo). I liked TI better than the Monte Carlo for its location and atmosphere. <br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend this hotel to others.	4	5	-1	4	4	5	-1	5

There is a $20 + tax daily resort fee, which covers the Internet in your room and the gym, whether you use these facilities or not. This extra charge makes it more expensive than other comparable hotels on the strip. The pool is overcrowded with beds lined up in rows touching. Long wait for poolside drinks, waitresses too busy chatting to young men. Staff in casino do nothing to enhance atmosphere, again long waits for drinks. Long queues at reception at all times.	2	3	-1	2	3	2	-1	2

I have a hip injury and rarely get good sleep, but I slept like a log every night, even with the Sirens of TI canons going off outside my room...I was completely oblivious. I have just discovered thanks to the helpful Facebook page that we can purchase this bed from the Gift Store- I am seriously considering it!<br/><br/>Staff- every person I encountered was friendly, professional and extremely helpful.<br/><br/>Location- fantastic, so close to everything yet tucked away enough that it was quiet and we had a room overlooking the Strip.<br/><br/>Services- lots of variety for food, things to do, etc. We LOVED Kahunaville!!! Randy is the best bartender!!! <br/><br/>The only cons: No bathrobes :( I love a hotel bathrobe after a hot bath or shower.<br/>The gap under the door meant that a bit of light came through from the hall at night, and every time someone let their door slam ours would shake too.<br/>The room was very dark during the day and even with every light turned on it was it was still dark... but these things were minor and didn't affect our stay really.<br/><br/>Overall: FANTASTIC!	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	5

We found the staff at the reception desk to be miserable, there was no tea and coffee facilities in the bedroom, the bedroom was very dark all the time, the pool area was overcrowded and you are all lined up next to one another like sardines, not ideal if you like your own space. Luckily we were only there 3 nights. Drinks were ridiculously expensive. We love travelling to the USA, but I can confidently say we will never be coming back to this hotel or Vegas, I'll leave it to the groups of young lads and girls on there stag and hen parties getting drunk every night.	2	3	-1	2	3	2	-1	3

Situated across the street from palaces like the Wynn, Palazzo, and Venetian, this hotel is in need of a makeover. It is older than its competitors on this part of the strip, and smaller. From what I hear, it's no longer under MGM Grand, but independently owned by the guy who owned the Frontier at one point. <br/>It was about 1/2 - 1/3 the price of the behemoths across the street and that's why I chose this place. I paid an avg of $127/night. <br/>The room is basic: bed, small desk, small fridge, 1 room (not a suite), safe, and pretty clean. The hallways smelled of smoke in a big way. wow! <br/>My view (see pic) was pretty nice... the Wynn towers all the way to Stratosphere. I was on the 18th floor. Unfortunately, i looked down on the TI show, so couldn't really see it too well from my room, except for the explosion scenes. <br/>The Siren's show is wonderful. You get a lot for a free show, but you don't have to stay at this hotel to see it. <br/>Buffet: average at best<br/>Pizza place downstairs (name I forgot): above average<br/>Casino: smoky, but enough table games with low limits ($10 blackjack and craps) - weekdays. <br/><br/>I would stay here again as a place to rest my head if my next conference is close by. It has all the basics unless you're looking for a suite (then I'm sure it'll be priced more)<br/>I would NOT bring my family to stay here. I've stayed at The Signature at MGM and the Palazzo, which are suites, smoke free, and great for young families!	4	5	-1	3	4	3	-1	3

Just like everyone is saying &quot;Check in lines are ridiculously long&quot;. I feel like the front desk is understaffed. Maybe that's why everyone working there seems so bitter. The rooms were nice, comfortable, very clean. Pool is overcrowded with a dj blasting music contstantly. Fun I guess but not when you need some quiet during the day after a long night. I'd say this hotel is great for young party crowds. The buffet was good although pricey. Loved Gilley's! That was my favorite part of TI. I really don't like being forced to pay resort fees when we don't use anything that it says it's for either. The location was good but think I'd like to try somewhere else next time.	2	4	-1	5	4	2	-1	2

The cool thing about TI was that my friend (and for the trip, my roommate) and I wanted to spend a little more for a better room, while the other two didn't for their room. TI has the rooms set up so that my room was connected by a door to a smaller room, and they easily accommodated us being next door! win-win! My room was very large with two bathroom spaces which was nice. We had a great view of the strip and even though we faced the lagoon, we werent bothered by the sirens show.	4	3	-1	3	4	4	-1	4

What we paid for what we got we were very happy with. Yes the check in staff are not very friendly - and even given that it was our honeymoon did not show any emotion whatsoever. Although when we arrived we were 4th in line it did take forever to check in and yes they fo charge $20 per day &quot;resort fee&quot; for noone knows what but be aware that you have to pay it so add it to the cost of the room when comparing. At the time the comparably priced hotels were the Luxor and Harrahs so I think we did get a good deal. Our room was enough for us - very clean with all the mod cons you would expect - getting to the room was quite a hike and you don't want to do it with impared judgement as there are several LONG hallways that lead away from the elevators and they all look the same so you will get lost. The rooms don't have any sort of kitchenette so if you buy drinks (the 7/11 down near the Luxor has cheap boos) clean out your rubbish bin, take it down to the ice machine, fill it up and you've got your very own cooler - and no we were not the only ones doing this. Location was great for exploring and views from the room back down the strip were fantastic - we would definately stay here again and recommend if the price is right then go for it.	4	5	-1	5	5	2	-1	5

We were very happy and splipped her a tip - which added a complimentary bottle of champagne taht we could order from room service upon arrival in our suite!<br/><br/>The Suite itself was very nice, 2 Bathrooms and lots of space. The bed was fantastic, a huge and comfortable pillowtop king bed. The champagne (from california) was really good.<br/>Our room had a part-strip view, we looked at the Fashion Show Mall and the Trump Tower.<br/><br/>The Casino Floor is very nice and orientation was easy - no getting lost while trying to find anything.<br/>The Buffet was the best we ever had in Vegas, great Sushi, fresh Tacos, delicious Pasta - unfortunately we were to full to try the pizza after that, but it also looked great ;-) Only the &quot;German&quot; dishes like Schnitzel looked terrible... The Desserts were unbelievable, freshly made all the time! I loved the Cr?me Brul?e best.<br/><br/>We watched the &quot;Sirens of TI&quot; show once. Well, the effects were great and the pirates and sirens nice to look at, but don't expect Cirque De Soleil ;-) <br/><br/>Location in the center of the strip is convenient, they also have a tram to the mirage next door and a pedestrian bridge to Fashion Sho Mall.<br/><br/>Would definitely recommend!	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	5

The location was good, the hotel is not far from the airport and everything is very accessible. We learned pretty early on that you need to use a cabstand at a hotel entrance if you need a ride somewhere.<br/><br/>There is a Starbucks right outside the entrance, and there is a walkway across the street to the Venetian, where we stopped at Walgreen's for waters and toiletries. The Mirage is right next door if you are interested in seeing the zoo exhibit.<br/><br/>We got a good rate for a Petite Suite and were very happy with the accommodation. There was a couch, small high top table with 2 chairs, 2 bathrooms, and the bed was extremely comfortable. There was plenty of closet space and the TV was nice. The only small downside was that the shower had a bit of a musty smell. <br/><br/>Breakfast in the hotel was great. They gave us a coupon for a &quot;$7.99 breakfast special&quot; which gives you about $1 off. <br/><br/>The resort is across the street from the Wynn and Encore, which are beautiful and you'll find better bars, casinos, pool, and restaurants. There's also a bus stop outside the entrance of TI that will take you down the strip.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend TI if you're looking for an accessible location and a comfortable place to sleep!	3	4	-1	4	3	4	-1	5

I was surpised at how &quot;low budget&quot; the hotel appeared to be. The room for instance had two queen sized beds but no double sinks in the bathroom. The room also did not come with typical amenities such as a coffee maker, microwave or refrigerator. Anything we purchased on the outside could not be reheated or saved for later even water to keep cold. The room however was very clean and the beds very comfortable so no complaints there. We were given vouchers for free lunch or dinner but only good Monday - Friday not during the weekend. So we used the vouchers on a Monday for lunch. Well we were so grateful we did not have to pay the $19.99 lunch price because the food was not good at all. There was no variety and the staff at the food counters were not friendly (our waitress Mary was the cutest thing in the world and very friendly). Overall if you are looking for a clean room and don't expect too much else this is a great place to stay. if minor comforts are your thing then I say go to the Venetian, the buffet I would avoid and go to another hotel for the food.	2	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

First, the location is excellent, mid-Strip close to all the new hotels. The service is friendly, helpful and the beds are sooo comfortable! Also, it is smaller than some of the new mega-hotels which makes it easier for me as I am mobility challenged. It is easy to get to the elevators, you don't have to walk miles once you're inside. Also, if we rent a car parking is very convenient. The hotel is connected to the Mirage by a tram and across the street from the Venetian. AND, they have a wonderful buffet, as well as a good variety of smaller restaurants and coffee shops! I would highly recommend this hotel. And we have, often, to our friends who have come with us or gone on their own Vegas Vacations!	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

I enjoyed the location, it was really close to almost ever we wanted to do, and it was easy to get around and figure out where you are going. We spent a bunch of time playing black jack, and we had the best time at the tables where the girls all wear chaps (seems a little racy!) the girls were really engaging, funny and made playing that much more fun. <br/>The room was nice, there were two bathrooms which was actually quite nice. There was also a door bell, which seemed weird, and was well used by our friends coming back to their rooms at all hours. I could have done without the door bell!<br/>I had been worried about staying at the TI because seemed smoky to me on a different trip when I walked through, though I didn't find it smoky in there at all, well other than when someone was smoking right beside me.<br/>Overall a great stay, good food options and I would stay there again for sure!!	5	5	-1	4	4	5	-1	4

We arrived around 3pm on a weekday. Check-in was fast (no wait at all) and friendly. I don't like the &quot;resort's fee&quot; they charge, even if it was a good deal for me this time. They advertise $62 rooms which are really $84.4 rooms because of this mandatory fee. I knew this in avance but oppose it on principle. The room was rather small but clean and adequately furnished, with a good bed. There even was a small refrigerator. The poolarea was crowded and the music was loud and obnoxious. The buffet was pretty good, they even had a sushi bar. This is one of the older hotels on the Strip and it shows. Location is good, close to the free shows at th TI itself, The Mirage and, a little further, The Bellagio. I would recommend this hotel if you're on a buget but still want to stay on The Strip.	3	5	-1	4	4	3	-1	4

We had a strip view room, excellent size, super beds, always clean and cleaned, services were great. Only thing lacking was a fridge, but problem solved by a quick visit to Walgreens across the road and a five dollar espy was purchased to keep my beers cold. Love the place, would always stay there. Oh and the pool, exceptional.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	-1

Bathroom could use an update. It would be nice if there was a coffee maker in the room, but then the Starbucks downstairs couldn't charge 4.50 for a medium coffee. But that's Vegas. Had some trouble connecting to their Wi-Fi, but after some hassle, they took the charges off my room. The resort fee is kinda ridiculous. They might as well roll it into the price instead of making it a 'mandatory extra'. <br/>I like the bar Gilley's. Great happy hour specials and a fun vibe. The mexican place is also very good. The pool area was pretty lacking. It desperately needs a refresh. A bit cheesy and unclean. The location of the hotel was ideal. The line for checking in and checking out was long and slow.	3	4	-1	4	3	2	-1	4

Got a strip view room, it was priceless! The view was absolutely amazing, we also had a pool view. We were high enough up to see the mountains also. The room was very nice, and surprisingly quiet. <br/> The hotel was easy to get around in unlike some of the others we visited. The atmosphere was great, it smelled amazing, and all service was fast and efficient, even check in &amp; check out. Parking was even very easy to get to, and find. rooms are very easy to find as Well.<br/> Kahunahville was much fun, as well as sirens of ti. VIP viewing is a must, great view.

This year (Oct 2011), we tried another hotel, but we chose to transfer to TI on our 2nd night for the reasons - <br/><br/>1. TI is not a huge hotel, you won't get lost inside the hotel. It's easy to find exits, escalators, elevators, etc.<br/>2. It is very close to Fashion Show Mall, which shopping travelers will find very convenient.<br/>3. Early check in and late check out was their on going freebie at that time, and it was well appreciated since we desperately wanted to get out from the hotel we came from, and our flight was still in the afternoon. <br/>4. Check in was fast. Rooms were clean, smelled good. WiFi fast. <br/>5. I requested for a room with a pleasant view, and finally - a view of Las Vegas strip. <br/>6. I think this is a family hotel especially when gaming is not your priority. It is a smaller hotel - which makes it a tourist friendly one.	5	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

But when we arrived early in the morning we were told to come back to check in at 11, so we hung around for a few hours and went back to the desk, where we were told to come back at 12, no real apology. When we got back at 12, there was a line of around a hundred people, because there were not enough staff on duty (lots of computer terminals unused), when we finally got to the front we were then told that there was an extra $20 Resort Fee, exclusive from the booking we had already paid on Hotels.com, which must be new or advertised in very small print as a number of people were upset about it. They gave us a sheet of paper in a plastic pouch to show what you get for the $20 and it was pretty much everything that comes as standard at any good hotel or one in Vegas (5th time in Vegas). Once checked in we spent some more time in the casino and I have to say, the drinks service has gone down-hill as we have gambled at TI before a couple of times. All in all, if you want better service there are at least 20 hotels where you will get this in Vegas.	3	3	-1	4	3	2	-1	4

Check-in took about 45 minutes on a Saturday at about 4pm. The room itself was on the 7th floor and our view was of a rooftop - if you can, ask for a higher floor. The room was exactly as pictured on TI's website, and sparkling clean. We had a mini-fridge but no coffee maker. We love the location of Treasure Island, close to The Mirage, The Wynn and the mall. Right across the street is a Walgreens where we stocked up on water and alcohol (be prepared to pay almost double for booze than you are used to at home). There's also a Starbucks right outside the main entrance of TI. <br/><br/>We had a great time here, there was never a long wait for the bars, taxis or restaurants. We had a wonderful dinner at Isla Mexican Kitchen inside the hotel. Service was amazing and the food even better. We never tried the TI buffet but did take the free tram over to Mirage for their Sunday brunch. (Best brunch I've ever had!) <br/><br/>Overall, Treasure Island doesn't have the bells and whistles of many other Strip-located hotels, but it's clean, has a great pool, and is centrally located. You can also find great deals on rooms if you sign up for their email alerts	5	5	-1	4	5	4	-1	4

The bell desk was very helpful when planning a day trip to the Red Rock Canyon. She did the calling and reserving. When we didn't feel like going out to eat we had plenty of choices right there at the hotel. The Isla there is the best place to eat. <br/>The room has a refrigerator which came in handy. The safe was good to since my husband doesn't like using credit cards and we could put our cash in there. You use your own code to secure it which was nice. <br/>Maid service came and went while we weren't there. Like they knew when we'd be gone.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Our flight got delayed and we reached there on 10/15/11 afternoon. There was a long line of about 30 people ahead of us and it took about 30-40 minutes to check us in plus I felt that the staff was not very friendly and warm. Then the room interior were in bad shape. The chairs looked like they were too old with the fabric wearing/tearing off. V poor interiors and upholstery. V tight rooms and all the furniture needed to be updated. Would definitely benefit customers to add a coffee machine and a microwave in as we paid 100 some $ per night.	2	5	-1	2	2	2	-1	3

We checked in at about 4pm on a Thursday afternoon and there was no queue at all (although we did notice at other times during the weekend that the queues for very long although they did seem to have lots of staff on duty). We were dealt with very quickly and were given an excellent standard room on the 25th floor on a corner plot above the pool (which gave us two windows, one looking down the strip towards the mirage, caesars palace etc, the other window giving a view of the Venetian and the palazzo). The room was nice, clean and spacious and well away from the lifts/ice and vending machines etc. We had no complaints with the room at all. The ipod docking station was a nice touch as well.<br/><br/>For breakfast each day we went to the hotel?? Kahunaville which did a large plate of eggs, sausages/bacon and breakfast potatoes ( $8.99) which kept us full for the whole day meaning we could save time and money by missing out lunch (well, maybe just a starbucks coffee and muffin).<br/><br/>We found that the hotel in general was very clean and well run. The location was very good as well ?right next to the shopping mall (Macy?? etc). From our room, we could watch the Mirage volcano and could also see the ballagio fountains when they shot into the air. The hotel did get very busy over the weekend, but the same is true of all of the hotels on the strip at the weekends.<br/><br/>The bad points I would consider mentioning would be as follows:<br/><br/>We dined at the buffet restaurant once, and that was once too many. We ate an early dinner there on a Friday night at about 5pm (before seeing Elton John) and were a bit surprised to see that they put the prices up at the weekend to $26.99 each. The food, although plentiful, was of a poor standard. I started with a plate of chinese which was ok, but cold. I then had a plate of various meats and the pork and a large rack of ribs was just full of fat and not cooked well either. My wife's choice of dishes were less than impressive also. The high cost of the buffet was not met by a high standard of food. The Thursday night we ate at Grilley's and I had a lovely burger and chili and was keen to return to try their other dishes. On the Saturday and Sunday nights they were too busy to offer a table straight away (about 6.30ish) and advised that we would have to wait for 30/45 minutes. This wouldn?? be a problem usually but I could see empty tables inside (maybe they were reserved but I don?? think that was the case as she didn?? ask if we had made a reservation). On the Monday night, (about 7pm) we walked past it on the strip first and looked in to see they had lots of empty tables (in the windows in full view of the public) yet we were still told there would be a long wait. We said to the concierge that there were empty tables inside and couldn?? we just go in and she said no and repeated that it would be a long wait. We went over to the venetian instead and sat down immediately at the restaurant that sits alongside the grand canal and had a very nice meal in a lovely setting with the Gondoliers singing as they paddled past.<br/><br/>The pool and hot tub were great, but at the weekend it was practically a rave scene with loud thumping music all day and people drinking and partying in the pool. In the middle of the day it was all just too much and meant you couldn?? really enjoy a swim or a quiet sunbathe.<br/><br/>The resort fees of $20 (+ taxes) are actually optional, although you have to pay for every day of your entire stay - you can?? just do one or two days. If you just want internet access in your room (which is all we wanted) then they have two price options: One is $7.99 for two hours of wi-fi, the other is $14.99 for 24 hours. Be warned though; we selected the two hour option on my iphone on 3 days (just so that we could update facebook with our photos each night) and when we checked out they charged us 3 X $14.99 and refused to budge or admit that there might have been an error with their system. As we were on a tight deadline and had a plane to catch, there was only so long that we could stand there disputing it, and in the end we decided to pay up and then challenge it once we got back home by writing to the manager.<br/><br/>Despite this overcharge, I would consider staying here again as the pluses outweigh the minuses and I felt it made an excellent base. Say no to the resort fees and if you need wi-fi, simply walk over the road to Macy?? as you can pick up free wi-fi in the store.	4	5	-1	4	4	2	-1	5

These was a bit of confusion at first about the discounted price we got from the on-line deal, but a single phone all took care of it. Upon arriving (~11pm) we checked in, which tool about 15min. We asked for a higher floor room not facing the pirate ship show, which was a great decision. Our room was on the 33rd floor and faced north (overlooking the Trump, Fashion Mall and the mountains in the distance). <br/><br/>The size of the room is adequate, the bathroom was much bigger than in many other hotels/casinos/resorts I've been to, but it could do with a bit of updating. The beds and pillows were very comfortable, which was a huge plus. Overall the room was clean and we had no problems with the house-keeping. The internet was down the first 24hrs we were there and we called the tech support about 3 times to esquire about when it would be fixed. Each time a tech came up to our room and was very helpful, but the internet was still down. We got the first day's service charge taken off out bill because of this. The people we dealt with at the customer service and reception desks were professional, friendly and helpful. <br/><br/>We went down to the pool twice to enjoy the nice weather and get a bit of sun. The pool area isn't huge, but enough to have fun - you don't come to Vegas for a tan anyways. The restaurants at TI are adequate, decent food, prices are not too bad either, but nothing to write home about.<br/><br/>We got a 35% discount coupon handed to us one day when walking through the casino to the Cirque du Soleil Mystere show playing in TI, which was very nice. That price actually was lower than the price offered for the same seats at one of those &quot;tickets for less&quot; last minute retailers, so do your research before buying. The show was beautiful and worth watching, especially if you have not seen a Cirque show before.<br/><br/>Overall all the staff was good, the service quick and the stay was pleasant.	4	5	-1	3	4	4	-1	5

Two HUGE bathrooms, a King size bed, and a sofa. also, ther was a small fridge and a safe.<br/>The TV is an LCD 32 or 37. However not large enough for the size of the room, and worse - it doesn't face the bed and can't be twisted all the way. Therefore, unless you sit on the sofa as if you are in your living room at home - the TV is almost useless...<br/>The staff was nice and very helpful when needed, but we were not allowed a late check out although the hotel was far away from full (a Monday).<br/>Gaming - many tables, many slots. No cheap games (BJ at least 10 dollars, Craps as well, etc.) even the Mirage had, at times, cheaper tables. <br/>Location - Used to be great, now noly fine. most of the action is southern to the TI location. It is next door to the Mirage and Fashion Show Mall, and opposite the Venetian and the Wynn, but it is not the heart of the action any more. The new hotels (besides the Trump) are southern even to the Bellagio, so it isn't close by.<br/>Value - we booked through LOWCOSTUSA - which gave us good service. The price was rediculesly low for this kind of room in a weekend - 160 USD. a Deluxe room would have cost 110 USD. <br/>HOWEVER - there is a resort fee of 20 USD per night. when I made the reservation I thought I am pre-paying for the resort fee and I will not be charged. I was partially wrong: Because it was an international reservation and I had an international billing address on my Credit Card - the resort fee was WAIVED. NOT pre-paid, but waived. That meant we did not get the extras that come with the resort fee, including WiFi connection. If you are ordering from a non American web site and you are told that the resort fee is &quot;pre-paid&quot; - ask the right questions and even call the hotel to make sure. <br/><br/>To cut a long story - short:<br/>The hotel is nice, a bit old fashioned in comparisson to the new ones. The location is OK. The Buffet is nice, but not outstanding - Go next door or across the street for a better Buffet for an extra 2-3 USD. <br/>If I know, I would NOT have paid the extra for a petite suite. I have better things to do with 50 USD per night than paying it for an extra bathroom in the room. <br/>It is a good value for the money you pay - but there are many of these hotels in Vegas. <br/>Enjoy your holiday.	5	3	-1	3	3	5	-1	4

We checked in late at night so of course no line up, we got room 30091 our friends got a room on the 17th floor. They did not have the room requested aval, being a King bed, but one with 2 queens on a higher floor over looking the strip and what a view it was south down the strip. Our friends were able to have their room changed to the 30th floor just a few doors down. We were given coupons for meals and drinks buy one get one 1/2 price, free drink when one bought, etc. Do try the sandwiches at Canters Deli in the hotel, they range in price from about $12-15.00 but my god they are huge, I couldn't finish mine had to do a take away. Our friends had the chicken strips that were also very tasty.<br/><br/>The food was fair, room clean, and as others have said the beds are great. The Sirens of TI show is a bit cheesie. Do get the bus pass that travels the strip a 24hr pass is $7.00 there is an express bus that jumps a fair distance or another one that hits every block, saves on the wear and tear of the feet.<br/><br/>We took in the Zoomanity show at New York New York, this show is an adult content Cirque del Soile that is a blast, very funny. We also did the Divas show at the Imperial Palace which was just as funny and entertaining. If you want a great dinner buffet take in the one at the Wynn, crab legs, fantastic prime rib, and desserts to die for, this was $36.00. <br/><br/>In all we really enjoyed our stay at Treasure Island, we found the staff very polite and helpfull, we have stayed at the Monty Carlo which was fine but the TI was just that much better.	5	4	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Stayed at TI - October 16th to October 19th 2011.<br/><br/>Treasure Island is a nice hotel with an excellent location on the strip. Check in was fast &amp; reception staff were helpful. Our room was clean &amp; well decorated. When we arrived the last person to have the room had shut the safe meaning we were unable to access, one quick call to reception &amp; a member of the security team came to the room within 5 mins to open it for us. <br/><br/>We didn't use the casino but as we walked through it to enter or exit the hotel, there did seem to be lots of people using the machines. <br/><br/>The restaurants are a little high priced, but that goes for pretty much all the hotels on the strip. We ate at Canters Deli &amp; the food was fine. There is a Fashion Shopping Mall opposite the hotel, with a food court where we went for breakfast. Also there is a Walgreen's close by which is very handy if you want to purchase snacks/drinks for your room. (Walgreen's also sells alcohol). <br/><br/>The pool area is nice, heated pool &amp; lots of loungers. We used the pool facilities on our last day. Check out is at 11am, however if you have a later flight time, the hotel porters will tag &amp; store your luggage for you to pick up.<br/><br/>If you get a chance make sure you watch the 'Sirens of Treasure Island' show. It is well worth seeing. We didn't like the $20 per night resort fee, but knew about it when we booked the hotel. The Wifi (which is included in the resort fee) worked well. <br/><br/>Overall we were impressed with Treasure Island &amp; would recommend to friends &amp; family.<br/><br/>ps: If you enjoy East Indian Food, we found a great buffet just north of the Encore Hotel.	4	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Spa was really nice although I didn't know they even had one from the website. Ask for Chin as she is excellent! A lot more expensive than other spas I have been to but vacation so what the heck. Breakfast plentiful and good in the coffee shop. Starbucks on site too. Mexican place was good too! Went to Gilleys one night and was unhappy they charged hotel guests to get in! Female bartender was VERY rude on 3 separate occasions! Don't waste your time there with so many other people happy to serve you!	4	5	-1	4	4	3	-1	4

It was amazing! We loved that TI is right in the heart of the strip and has easy access to everything. The casino was busy but not too busy. The Petite Suite had 2 bathrooms...one with a jacuzzi tub! My only complaint was that we flew in too early. They checked our luggage at TI but we couldn't get into our room until 7 hours later!!! Our rooms were booked with friends and they couldn't guarantee we would even be on the same floor. It worked out that we were but after much hassle. All in all, TI was an amazing stay. Use your 2 for 1 coupon at their Buffet. Visit Kahunaville for an inexpensive breakfast.	5	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

The hotel had everything we needed albeit, we didn't spend much time in the hotel. I guess a big selling point for us was the cost versus the proximity to the strip (ie the main road).... VEGAS is soooo misleading in terms of distance from one end of the strip to the other. You think the walk from 1 hotel to the next is only a few minutes away BUT it's not.... The buildings are just so big so it's misleading. My wife and I walked from TI to the Luxor (other end of the strip) and toured other hotels on TI's side along the way. It was around 8 hours to do so.... We got the monorail back. I would probably stay there again if the same price was given. I booked 5 months earlier so I got a good price.	4	4	-1	4	3	4	-1	4

There were virtually no problems. When we arrived, there was a slight mix up with our room and they gave us a free upgrade to a pararamic view room. Greatly appreciated! :) Our room was beautiful, a huge King bed that felt like sleeping on clouds, a chaise lounger, a beautiful bathroom. Our area of the hotel was even quiet, other than the TI Sirens show when it was going on. We were so happy!<br/><br/>Aside from a fabulous room, you are smack right in the heart of the strip with easy access to just about everything. The Deuce pick up is a quick walk between TI and the Mirage.<br/><br/>The buffet at TI was great too, a huge variety something for everyone, most defintely your money's worth, not to mention the coupons for 2 for 1 in the room. We also went to Kahuanville for some tiki style food and drinks and to watch the flare bartenders, AMAZING!<br/><br/>All in all an amazing 4 nights we will never ever forget, expect us back at Treasure Island!	5	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

We won't however stay at TI again. When we booked our trip we booked a room with a strip view and a king size bed but we ended up with a view of the fashion mall and two queen size beds instead. Not the end of the world but disappointing all the same.<br/><br/>The room we had was large and spacious but I would have to say that although the bed linens seemed to be changed everyday, the sheets and pillow cases had all sorts of stains on them, which frankly grossed me out notwithstanding that they smelt laundered. Also, the beds were extremely uncomfortable, way too soft and felt like they haven't been replaced in years. If you have back problems you are forewarned. The bathroom was again huge but the faucet in the sink is so big that there is hardly any room to wash your face etc. Also the caulking around the tub and grout in floor tiles was dirty and need to be replaced in some areas. Not major issues but it didn't leave a great impression either. <br/><br/>Save your money and don't eat at the buffet in TI. We attended the Sunday brunch and the food was mediocre and the selection was actually the worst I have ever encountered at a buffet. You get better value and quality of food at the Denny's across the street beside the Venetian. After this experience we did not bother eating at TI again during the trip.<br/><br/>If you are like us and are looking to spend some time by the pool, again this hotel is not for you. The pool area is small and not really that well maintained. Also, when you are gambling there aren't that many waitresses around to provide drinks. This really stuck out because when we gambled in other hotels along the strip it seemed we weren't at a machine two minutes before a waitress came by and asked if we would like a drink. <br/><br/>What saved this hotel from being rated poor was the location. You can not beat it. All the main attractions are right there. We had tickets for Elton John and for the Cirque show O, so it was really close to walk to Ceasers and Bellagio. <br/><br/>I know a lot of people say you don?? spend a lot of time in your room, which is true but, when you are in your room you are exhausted and want a comfortable place to crash out. For what you pay to stay at this hotel you are paying strictly for its location and you are totally compromising on amenities and comfort.	3	5	-1	3	2	2	-1	1

I think nowadays you can find a better deal since they do charge resort fees. They seemed to have modernized the room furniture since my last stay here so it looks better. It is across from the Venetian, Palazzo, and Wynn so a little further from the city ctr action. <br/><br/>The service I found to be pretty poor. It took us more than 30 mins to check in! My friends and I visited the pool and it wasn't crowded at all since we went at 3:30 and it closes at 6, but they still had signs on the cabana areas indicating they could be reserved for a fee (I think that when the pool is dead, they should open those cabanas on a first-come, first-served basis). People were out lounging on the chairs and we were all napping in the sun when two workers went around taking down all the adjustable chairs and making so much noise. It was rude, and they didn't even seem to care at how bothersome they were being. Small gripe but if they want to stay in the game when other resorts are popping up all over the place, they should aim their focus on customer service.	3	3	-1	3	3	2	-1	-1

Beds were comfortable, bathroom was clean and spacious. Long bathroom counter to put things on. First morning, it didn't look like they cleaned the bathroom too well, but every other morning it was spotless. TI Sirens show was great - you have to see it when in Vegas. Location of TI on strip is great. Near Walgreens if you want to buy cheaper beverages than they serve in the bars and restaurants. Krispy Kreme donuts sold upstairs by tram station at TI - nice and fresh every morning - YUM. Only complaint is that the TI is VERY smoky smelling and they use some sort of deodorizer to cover up the smell which makes it even worse. Casino was nice, not a lot of waitresses to offer you drinks while playing the machines. Food expensive at the hotel's restaurants, but that is the way it is at most of the restaurants on the strip. Walk to StripBurger next to Fashion Show Mall (walkway is connected to TI by way of escalator) and order the malts. BEST malts I have ever had. Resort fee is ridiculous - how many of those services do guests really use? I suppose that is how they make their money. We did know about the resort fee up front, so knew we would be paying it. We would stay at the hotel again, but did not like the smoky stale air throughout the hotel.	3	5	-1	3	3	4	-1	4

We came to the Treasure Island for a conference. We will not return to it voluntarily.<br/><br/>The Treasure Island is one of those Las Vegas hotels that?? popular because it?? cheap, one of the many less than $100 a night hotels that are easy to find. It recently underwent a major renovation. But while it?? clean, the carpeting looks good and the furniture is decent, an aura of don??-give-a-crap runs through it. If love is in the details, they hate you.<br/><br/>There was no bath mat in the bathroom. One of the towels, while ostensibly laundered, looked black. The maid didn?? leave glasses in the bathroom. <br/><br/>Our room featured the Incredible Sloping Mattress that gave my wife the feeling that she was going to fall out of bed. She ended up sleeping diagonally.<br/><br/>Then there?? the shower gel. I don?? know who along the supply chain ok?? this. First, it?? not a gel; it comes out of the bottle like a paste. I think the color was supposed to be gold (gold, Treasure Island, get it?) but it?? light brown. Ever change the diaper on a two-week-old? That?? what oozed out of the bottle. My wife, on the other hand, said Snot Rockets came out of the bottle. Same color, same consistency.<br/><br/>My wife couldn?? charge anything to the room even though I told them to make sure she was on the room and they assured me that it had been done.<br/><br/>The food ranged from ok, to merely edible, to inedible. We sent back a shrimp cocktail where the mushy shrimp had obviously been thawed and refrozen. Multiple times. They serve some of the worst coffee I??e ever tasted. Another guest, seeing my wife in the elevator with her Starbucks, said the coffee served in the hotel was ??atered-down mud.?br/><br/>I found one guy, a Filipino restroom attendant named Manny, who gave a crap about his job. Way to go, Manny! The rest of the staff should take a lesson.<br/><br/>If you??e only interested in the per-night cost, this is a place for you. If you??e looking to have a better experience, you would be better off looking elsewhere.	3	3	-1	3	3	1	-1	2

My boyfriend and I got to the hotel at around 11:30PM on a Friday night, and were pleasantly surprised to see such a short line-only 2 people ahead of us. We get to the counter and the woman checking us in was scrambling to find us a room. I look around and see all of the other front desk workers scrambling as well. I overheard several of them tell the other guests that they only had smoking rooms available, but they could change rooms the following day if there were any available. Everyone looked pissed, and I imagined that I was about to be also. The woman makes a couple of calls and tells us that she'll be upgrading us to a petit suite because none of the standard rooms were available. I was confused as to how they had no other rooms available, despite booking my trip with them a month prior to our trip, but decided to keep my mouth shut and enjoy our upgrade. We get to our room, which is on the 3rd floor, directly across from the spa and next to the elevators. We get inside and the room is pretty nice-2 bathrooms and a sitting area. I open the window and find that we have a horrible view of the casino roof and right in front of us is a huge generator. We got absolutely no light during the day and the room felt like a basement. At around 8am every morning we both woke up to people talking really loudly in the elevator and spa area. There was a constant flow of people directly outside of our room, and decided to give up on sleeping. Despite being put into a horrible room, the hotel itself was nice and in an awesome location. If we were put in a room on a higher, quieter floor, my review probably would've gone up to four stars.	3	5	-1	1	4	2	-1	1

House keeping did a great job too. Happy with the location of the hotel on the strip. Had a room facing down the strip on the 35th floor.

The Buffet restaurant which we received a free voucher for had a good variety of mains and an excellent range of desserts !

It was reasonably priced, mid-range for a hotel in Las Vegas. I think the best thing about the TI is the location. Very central on strip with easy access to other hotels and Vegas attractions. There is a Walgreens across the street, which is handy. <br/><br/>The room was updated and clean, and as many others have stated, the beds were very comfortable. We were assigned a room designed for someone in a wheelchair, which we did not ask for or need. I thought it was strange that they would give this room to someone who did not require it. They must have a lot of these access configured rooms. We didn't bother asking for a room change. There was a small refrigerator in the closet, which was handy for keeping bottled water cold. <br/><br/>We arrived at 11 PM on a Monday night, so no line ups at that time of night. We knew about the $20 a day service fee, which is over $150 for the week with tax. You pay this fee up front when you check in. <br/><br/>All of the staff that we encountered were courteous. <br/><br/>The service was good in the restaurants we used; the food was average and moderately priced. <br/><br/>The worst thing about this hotel was the people smoking just about everywhere on the first floor. I have never seen so many smokers in one place since the 1970s. Smoking was allowed in the halls, casino, and pool area. This is not unusual for Vegas as it appears to be a smokers paradise. If I return to this city, I will look for and book a non-smoking hotel; they do have some.	3	5	-1	3	4	4	-1	5

Aside from it being a bit dated, a lot frayed and tattered, and just plain old smoky and beat down as other reviewers have eloquently discussed, it is the laconic, anesthetized, indifferent staff who ostensibly (work?) at there that put TI in a case unto itself.<br/><br/>Not a single employee from the front desk, to the elevator security dude, to the casino dealers, cocktail servers, cage cashiers, or pool staff seemed to give a hoot about the guests. Our safe was not functioning and despite repeated calls for help it remained unusable. Checking in was a monumental undertaking... We literally gave up and returned later hoping we made a good decision: not really, but golly, it must be tough to display a sense of urgency if obviously that is not a job requirement. Wait.. I'm wrong... We got a shake down for a tip from the bell hop while leaving our bag before our later flight...and housekeeping was kind enough to offer an early knocking both mornings of our stay. Unusual, as checkout was at 11, and the knocking on our last day was at 9:45... <br/><br/>No late check outs, no friendly service, rooms are not impeccably clean, and the casino staff was just plain uninviting and obviously not motivated. The one positive is the location. Otherwise, it's just unpleasant.	2	4	-1	2	2	1	-1	-1

Check to make sure about conventions that may be taking up most if not all the resources of the hotel and ruining your stay, like it did ours.<br/><br/>We used to stay there every year. We got to TI to see signs all over the place announcing the national convention for deaf people. I have no problem with people with disabilities. I do have a problem with rude people and they were the most rude since they had over taken the facility. Crowding out the areas outside elevators and NOT moving. Of course they use sign language and one guy almost hit me in the elevator as he was &quot;arguing&quot; with another guy and swinging his arms all over the place. My wife actually did get hit inadvertently in the face trying to pass by another crowd of conventioners. <br/><br/>TI also put us above the pool as we asked for the quiet side of the hotel vs. the strip. They did not tell us that they had made an exception to the 8 PM pool closing for this convention and had it open until 1 a.m with a live band that had the bass cranked up so loud the windows vibrated. Calling the front desk, their response was, &quot;we left a note in your room about the band and the noise&quot;. We found the note after looking buried under the hotel folder and magazines. TI was unwilling to move us as they were &quot;booked&quot; due to the convention.<br/><br/>This was out last and final visit to TI	3	4	-1	4	3	1	-1	1

Because it is vacation, we stay at 4-star or higher hotels exclusively on The Strip. <br/><br/>Our most recent stay was only for an overnight as we prepared to fly out of Vegas, and was quite pleased at finding a stay at Treasure Island for a very nice price. But owing to that old adage, &quot;I got what I paid for...&quot; It started with the trek from self-parking to the Front Desk, hauling luggage and a 2 year-old through so much smoke that I was left to ponder if the casino was on fire or a rock concert was about to begin. Our 45-minute wait in line to check-in to the hotel so thoroughly soaked our clothing, hair and skin with the smell of cigarette smoke, that we proceeded to our rooms to shower. Finding hair on the shower walls and near the drain of the tub did nothing to alleviate the skanky feel of the place. The rooms were alright... beds that creaked under the weight of a 30-pound toddler and broken alarm clock, notwithstanding. <br/><br/>Bottom line, it just didn't look like anyone cared to re-invest some profit in hotel upkeep. Rather generous to call it a 4-star hotel in that it was more 3-star and heading very quickly further south in ratings. The secondhand smoke alone took months off my family's lives.... so, we've scratched that itch. Treasure Island is in the past, never to be re-visited again except maybe to stop in and change a diaper as we walk past it on The Strip. I can think of no better poetic act...	3	4	-1	3	1	3	-1	3

We chose a strip view/higher up floor, with a floor to ceiling window, and 2 bathrooms (his/hers). The room had a large spa tub, and the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. The hotel is very nice with many shops and amenities available. The only complaint I had was that I was rather shocked by some of the lack of service, and grumpy employees, especially during the weekdays. If you are expecting to be treated like a special guest or paying customer, I'd try another hotel. Next time I will probably try another hotel as well. Overall, I got my money's worth, but I'm not in a hurry to come back if you know what I mean.	3	4	-1	4	4	2	-1	5

BUT SO DARK!! I felt like we were in a cave and we could barely see what was in our suitcases. The food at Pho was terrible (two of our party became sick). The whole casino seems tired and run down to a large degree..not too many people winning anything. It seemed like anyone staying there was on the same floor. I only had one person get off on a floor other than ours. However, the room rate is good and as long as you don't plant on spending much time in the room or casino you should be okay. The location is excellent with the mall close by. It's nice to have a Starbucks right outside of the casino. If I'm going to stay in an older hotel, I'd stay in the Flamingo again. Just for sentimental value! I really am tired of run down casinos and uber high-end ones. I like the gawdy glitz and glam of the old days! TI needs to have a few more machines ringing and yahoos at the tables. No excitement there at all. I stopped in Bill's House of Gambling, and for a small and old casino it had the excitement and hype that TI needs! It was packed and friendly and had that old school feel!	5	5	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

Its opposite the Wynn Hotel and next door to the Mirage. Our room had a huge bed, floor to ceiling windows with a view of the Mirage and TI swimming pool. <br/><br/>There were plenty of restaurants to chose from in the hotel, ranging from a pizza place and Starbucks, to a Steak House. We had breakfast in the Buffet restaurant which was about $15 each and consisted of a help yourself self service buffet. There were cereals, cooked breakfast, pastries, pancakes, sushi, chinese and made to order omlettes, to drink you got tea, coffee and there was various juice to chose from. <br/><br/>One of the bars in the hotel is called Gillies which has a bull riding area and a dance floor. It was great fun entertainment, and if you go in on a Sunday night they have girls in bikinis bull riding which seemed very popular. There was a karaoke on there too on Tuesday. Drinks weren't cheep at around $6 for beers and $10 for a spirit, but they have promotions on various drinks each night. <br/><br/>The casino has loads of slot machines to chose from and card tables, though we never did the tables as soon as you sat at a slot we were offered a free drink. This went for all the hotels on the strip we visited. <br/><br/>The pool area is a really good size. They have complimentary towels which you can use, loads of sun beds and a decent pool with a separate jacuzzi. The jacuzzi was really warm and the pool temperature was ok.<br/><br/>There is a bus stop just outside of the hotel where you can purchase 24 hour tickets for $7 which takes you up and down the strip - an essential buy as its a long walk from one end to the other. <br/><br/>At check in we were charged $80 resort tax but this enabled us free internet access and some other little extras. Check in was realitively painless though there was quite a queue, we also got a couple of vouchers to eat at their restaurants at discounted prices.<br/><br/>The rooms were cleaned daily, towes changed daily, complimentary toiletries were stocked every day. There was an ironing board, iron, fridge, flat screen TV, alarm clock, safe and hairdrier in the room. There was plenty of wardrobe and drawer space. There are ice stations around the hotel on each floor and you are supplied with an ice bucket in your room. Be wary not to leave any money lying around or the maid presumes its her tip!<br/><br/>The only downside to all the hotels in Vegas is that they sometimes stink of smoke as its legal to smoke in the casino areas. <br/><br/>We hired a car to visit the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam from Dollar car hire which is based in the hotel which was very convenient and cheap. You dont pay for hotel parking in vegas :) The Grand Canyon is a couple of hours drive to the West Rim from the hotel and about 5-6 hours to the south rim. We went to the West rim which cost each person $43 to enter the site, this included a coach to Eagle Point and Guano Point and time at the Ranch learning how to be a cowboy! You could pay extra for the skywalk approx $30 but we saw what we wanted without doing that. The Canyon is spectacular, beware there are no guard rails or fences (scary). The drive from the strip is fine and you get some great views. There is a few miles of gravel rather than tarmac road on the way up to the viewing points, dont let it put you off its fine, just drive carefully! And dont hit any cows, you get fined $3000 for each one and there is about one hit a week!<br/><br/>The hotel like many on the strip has no tea or coffee making facilities in your room. This would have been nice. There is a pirate ship show every night about 3 times per night. All in all a great place to stay, seemed safe enough and good value for money. There are more impressive hotels to stay at like Caesars Palace or the Wynn but this is a good hotel and a great base for exploring.	4	5	-1	4	3	3	-1	4

I arrived in vegas around 10 pm and took the shuttle to Ti. I arrived at the hotel around 11 pm and I only had to wait 2 minutes in line to check in. I asked for a room away from the sirens show and was offered a room on the 27th floor. I went up to my room and checked out my room to see how it was. The room was clean and spacious, with a great view of the south strip, as well as the rio hotel and a nice view of the red rock mountains. I had 2 queen beds in my room, but I didnt mind that since I enjoyed the view out of my window. I have to say my bed was comfortable and it was easy to sleep. The next day, I checked out the hotel and found out it was pretty easy to get around the facility. I liked the fact that there is a skywalk to connect you to the fashion show mall, which can connect you to the wynn across the street. The pool area was small compared to other resorts on the strip. It wasnt hard finding a lounge chair to sit on and read a book to pass the time away. It was nice to be able to eat lunch by the poolside at kahunaville patio, but the menu was a bit limited in choice. Overall, the hotel is a good value and it was clean and neat in appearance. The staff at the hotel were polite and professional and my stay at Ti was pleasant.	4	3	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

We got to check in early at 11:00am on Sunday Oct.23rd instead of 3:00pm. There was a line but it moved some what quick. We went with two other couples, we want the same floor and near eachother. The person checking us in say OK but before she could not finish our reservations, our room was given away. They up graded us to a different room on the same floor. Not much of a upgrade but nice. The bed was great, room very clean - air conditioner could have been better. They did mess us our name with my father - in - law so everything we put on the room was charged to him. The Resort fee is a joke - I know some people on here say it optional but they told us we had to paid.<br/><br/>We had a very friendly person who checked us in - our maid was very nice and friendly. The bartenders were another story - No one seemed to have a smile on their faces. I don't care if you are betting one credit or five credits on a machine - you are still losing $20 to $40 dollars at a time. We could not get a bartender to get us a drink with alcohol or water. And my niece wanted a bottle water and was told she had to pay for it after playing $20 or $30 but only one credit at a time. <br/><br/>I know that not too many people love their jobs but really you should fake it. I work with the public and most people on vacation want to see happy people. Kind of like bet big to win big but in this instance smile more bigger tips. If you are looking for fun bartenders go to cosmo the bartenders were great. They ask how we were enjoying our trip. Not one bartender at TI asked anything about our trip. Would we stay there again - maybe because of location but not for service.	3	4	-1	4	4	2	-1	4

I??e stayed there twice and wouldn?? hesitate to go back. The location is perfect, right in the middle of the Strip, so you get a pretty good view from most rooms. Check-in staff have always been friendly and I??e never waited more than 15 minutes to check in or out. Rooms are clean and serviced daily.<br/><br/>The pool area is great and has plenty of sun all day. There?? a bar which serves frozen cocktails and beers etc., and waitress service if you??e too lazy to get off the lounger. Most people seem to take full advantage of the bar, so it?? probably not somewhere to bring small children.<br/><br/>I really like the casino and bar area. Even on visits when we??e stayed elsewhere, we usually stop by the Sea Breeze to enjoy the cocktails and watch people lose at roulette. The table minimums are reasonable compared to other hotels nearby, but it?? only a short walk up to Circus Circus or Slots-a-fun if you fancy something a bit cheaper!<br/><br/>Overall the TI has a great combination of location, price, and amenities. One of the best value hotels on the Strip.	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1

While it isn't on the super luxurious strata of the Wynn, it is a very good value for money. We had no complaints. The rooms are clean and fairly recently upgraded. The casino is always busy with an &quot;active&quot; feeling because I think more people stay here due to the prices, so it always felt fun. If you are wanting high luxury, go with Wynn, Venetian or Bellagio, but if you aren't planning to spend a ton of time in your room, go with Treasure Island as it is a very good value. And don't miss Garth Brooks - fantastic!	4	4	-1	4	4	3	-1	5

Rooms are very nice, clean and well appointed. The decor in the room was an updated contemporary look which we liked a lot. Shower was spacious with great water pressure. we had a strip view room on a higher floor which was great. The casino itself was not on par with the newer hotels, it was much smaller and outdated in comparison to other hotels, also the colors/lighting on the casino floor was kinda dark and depressing so we did not stay and gamble much in our hotel. Luckily, TI is situated in a very central spot and was within walking distance hotels like the venetian, Palazzo, ceasars palace, bellagio, and city center so we could walk and be in any one of these within minutes. <br/>The room rate was very inexpensive compared to other hotels. we got to stay at the TI for 2 night at $60 per night which was great. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the TI and can definately recommend this hotel for the price and the rooms but not the casino.	4	4	-1	5	4	3	-1	5

When you have travelled a good part of the day this was disappointing. When we booked online we booked a room with a king sized bed. We ended up with a room with two queen beds. If we wanted two queen beds we would have booked two queen beds. We were told that what you book is a &quot;request&quot; it is not what you end up with. We have stayed in several different hotels in Vegas over the years and have always been placed in the room we had booked. Now on to the rest of the stay.<br/>When we went to our room only 1 of the keys worked. The room is outdated and there were marks all over the walls and the furniture is badly nicked and bruised. The clock radio was from the early '80's and did not work. We were in a smoking room but there were no ashtrays. There is no coffee pot but that is standard for a room in Vegas. When you are in the bathroom you can clearly hear the guests in the room above. <br/>When I went to the washroom I looked at the side of the bathtub and the parts to the shower were stacked on the edge. This was the first call to the front desk. We waited for 1/2 an hour for the maintenance &quot;engineer&quot; to come fix the shower.<br/>We decided to order from room service. The cheese burgers are $16.95 a piece. We were hungry so we called down just to be told that we were not registered to that room. We were told to call the front desk. This process took another 1/2 hour to get us registered in a room that took us 45 minutes to initially register in. The next day, my sister-in-law told us that when they took the elevator to their room there was vomit in the elevator. On the third day, we returned to our room to find that housekeeping hadn't even cleared away our 20 empty drink cans. If you think you will get a drink while you are sitting at a slot machine...think again. The service was terrible and you are more likely to grow humps than to get a drink. The buffet is $16.95 per person (they seem to like this figure) so if you are looking for an affordable breakfast, don't go to the buffet. The &quot;resort fee&quot; is $22.00 a day so factor this into the cost of the room before you decide to stay here. My husband and I will never stay at this hotel when we are in Vegas again (which is this coming February). We have stayed in The Flamingo, Harrah's, Mandalay Bay and the Monte Carlo and have had a great stay in each of these hotel. The only positive to Treasure Island is that the bed was comfortable. So, if you are going to Vegas to sleep book at Treasure Island!	1	1	-1	1	2	1	-1	4

Nevertheless, the room was excellent, we were given the choice of two queensized beds or one king size and opted for the kingsize - excellent and very comfy indeed. We had the choice of smoking or non smoking although we could smell smoke outside our room anyway, probably unable to escape this due to the casino setting. The casino itself was extremely smokey, which was noticeably more than any of other casinos that we frequented. Kahunaville was excellent, friendly staff and the 'big kahuna' is a must for cocktail lovers! The pool area is very good, the hot tub great for the overcast days (if there are any). The hotel position is excellent being just across from the Venetian and over the road from the Fashion Show Mall - cant fault the shopping. The 'show' was absolutely dreadful - pirates of the caribbean its not! More like a sleazy prelude for a mucky movie! Dont bother going to see it! Gilleys bar is within Treasure Island - this too was awful - very outdated and very smokey indeed - a definite no no.	4	5	-1	5	4	4	-1	5

I ask instead if we could be put on a high floor with a nice strip view and we were given a room on the 30th floor with a great view down the entire strip.<br/><br/>We like the TI a lot for the price. The room was spacious and beds were very comfortable. Yes some of the furniture and fixtures are getting a little worn but it was a nice clean room. We don't sweat the small things like a chip on a table or a scuff on the desk. Everything worked fine. All the staff we encountered desk, housekeeping, casino and valet, were always friendly and courteous.<br/><br/>We ate at Gilley's and the service as fantastic. We had two servers helping us and the manager also stopped by to make sure we were taken care of.<br/><br/>The casino is nice in that you can get around pretty easy and they have table games to fit most every budget.<br/><br/>There is easy access to the fashion show mall from one side of the hotel and a tram to the Mirage from the other side. There is a cool little everything is $10 store upstairs for things you might have forgotten like socks, sunglasses etc.<br/><br/>The pool area is a little small but I think it is cool the way it is laid out.

My colleagues and I picked this because it was cheaper than the Venetian (where the conference was) and it was just across the street. For the most part it was a good stay. There were a couple thigs that put me off starting with cleanliness. The room was hot when I went in and I noticed the air conditioner was on. I called down to the desk...nooone came...I left and went to dinner and called again. They had someone up in 10 minutes. He opened the area where the filter was and the amount of filth in the filter was disgusting. <br/><br/>The next morning I went to use the iron and it was covered in black remnants. I called down to the desk...used a coworkers iron and when I came back that night...same iron...same mess.<br/><br/>I do not totally blame the hotel as they are very busy and an iron was probably the last of their concerns...but it was off putting.<br/><br/>The rooms are nicely decorated and lots of space. Large bathroom was good.<br/><br/>Best part of this property are the food choices. Phenomial!!!! The buffet was amazing as well as their bar Kahunaville. Awesome drinks that you basically get a show for when you order. Next time I will for sure be going back to both...but will probably opt for the Trump or Mirage for my room.	2	5	-1	4	2	3	-1	5

I'm sure at one time you were quite a fine hotel, but that is certainly no longer the case. Yes, there was a long line for check-in, but that's to be expected. The room lighting was terrible - which is especially a problem in the bathroom when you're trying to do your makeup. The duvet had a hole in it and everything was rough around the edges. The room size was decent, though and the bed was pretty comfy.<br/><br/>My room faced the pirate show, which means there are cannons, fireworks and music at 11:30 each night. And it was LOUD. I know most people aren't trying to sleep that early in Vegas, but being there for a trade show meant I was exhausted and ready to sleep. <br/><br/>When you're ready to check out, make sure you leave extra time to wait in line if you need a copy of your bill. They don't just slide it under your door like other hotels. And there was also a long wait to check bags or retrieve checked bags. <br/><br/>I agree with an earlier review that said drink service in the casino was bad. Service at Isla was also terrible (but the cocktails were yummy and there's a good happy hour from 4-7).	3	4	-1	2	3	2	-1	3

We were playing downstairs at the slots and there were more &quot;working girls&quot; than waitresses in the casino. Some of which didn't look old enough to be in the casino. We approached the front desk and they informed us that, &quot;it's vegas, there's nothing we can do about it&quot;. When we asked them to contact a manager they called a supervisor and were informed that this is las vegas they can't remove people in their casino. These ladies were quite obvious and not at all descrete about approaching men and stating that they were ready and willing to do anything for money. - Not a great environment that you want to experience when spending time in vegas with your spouse.	2	3	-1	3	4	2	-1	4

We were 3 girls travelling celebrating our friend's 30th.<br/>TI ended being our choice because of a good sale price on Expedia, decent reviews on TA, and a few colleagues who recommended staying there. <br/><br/>We chose a Strip View room, and were treated to a 34th floor room with amazing view. The window WAS floor to ceiling, but not as wide as we thought it might be. Still nice though.<br/><br/>The resort has no balconies. It, at least on the 34th floor, was quiet. Check in was easy, though we did see times where the line up was long. Beds were comfy, not top of line but clean. Iron, safe and hairdryer are in rooms. Room service was good, they brought us extra towels no problem. They did want to charge us $5 for extra wine glasses though, which should be the sort of things the silly resort fee covers. <br/><br/>The rooms were clean and good sized. The bathroom was big and clean, with a large counter for our things. <br/><br/>There is temp control in the room, which is nice. They do not have mini fridges, but they actually brought us one on request :). <br/><br/>We ate at the asian restaurant which was decent, nothing amazing but did the trick. <br/><br/>The maps of the strip make TI look a little far from the &quot;centre of action&quot;,but it is not. I liked the area, a little less hectic and cleaner than the exact centre. <br/><br/>While in Vegas, some recommendations:<br/> &quot;Vegas&quot; the show is the one to see if you want to see old Vegas style. Kiosks in some hotels (ex Casino Royale) see half priced tickets to all shows, go there before buying tickets at the venues. The roller coaster at NYNY is fun. The Belagio fountain is a MUST to see. The pool at Caesar's palace is FREE to go to, take advantage of this nice pool! Book a shuttle from the airport, there are many companies and it is only 7$ per way per person. <br/><br/>Some people recommended we hire VIP hosts to get us into clubs. While this service isn't too pricey and is handy, I don't think it is a must if you are girls. We waited in line, but got pulled in fast. Guys, on the other hand, have a harder time, which is an unfair standard but seems to be the way of things. There were plenty of club representatives on the street offering you guest-list, which is a start but you still wait in line. We connected with Adam from Tao and Lavo nightclubs and that worked out well. If you want to book VIP, we got good reviews from a friend about Noah at VIP Vegas. <br/><br/>All in all, I would stay at TI again. The price, location, cleanliness and rooms were perfect for us.	4	5	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

We were happy to get upgrated to a strip room . The room was clean and lighting was a little dim but okay. Every thing was good except for the bad shampoos.........who has brown colored shampoo? The only bad part was they have a new bar called Gilleys and it was a smoke trap . Other than that all was good . they even comped our first night.

The whole Vegas thing is great and fast paced. Treasure Island was a good choice well located on the strip. We went with West Jet Vacations out of Ottawa a great choice for travel.<br/>The Hotel has a buffet thats high quality food and comfortable rooms and not dated. We watched the free show and its well done. the casino was a good size and we enjoyed slots. We are not big gamblers so we visited alot of hotels walked the strip from one end to the other. the shopping was great my wife bought so much and the prices were fair. we took the bus and its clean and safe. The best deals are on the street at the discount booths for examble we bought buffet tickets for our own hotel and saved 50% the kiosks are called showtime. We ate at Balieys steakhouse with a ticket and got 2-4-1 tickets and saved $50. We went to see the show Jubilee and its very good also the fountains @ Belagio are breathtaking at night. We walked everyday and had a great trip.<br/>Overall<br/>treasure Island a good value for money and /West Jet Vacations are top notch	4	5	-1	4	3	4	-1	4

Food and beverage was pricey at this location, but that is standard in Las Vegas. Our room was clean and bed comfortable. We had a great view. Overall, no complaints about the room.

Treasure Island is a nice hotel, it's in a great location, across from the Venetain, Mirage, Wynn and Palazzo. We checked in at 1:30 pm, got the room that I had requested with no line at all, we did the automatic check out which was a snap. The bell service was fast and very friendly. We had a deluxe room that had view of the strip and the Sirens Cove. The room was very clean, the bed was comfy with nice bedding. The bathrooms are large with a deep soaking tub along with a seperate shower. You can ride the tram to the Mirage. Also just a short walk to the Fashion Mall. We ate at the El Segunda Sol mexican restaurant, which is at the Fashion Mall, this is bar scene go somewhere else to have dinner. We only ate at the buffet for breakfast, $17.00 per person, they make great omelets, <br/>the atmosphere and service is good, the lady working a front desk was very nice.<br/>The Sirens show is a bit cheesy, but ok for a free show. Lots of people go to watch the show so go early enough to get a good view. The casino is ok, not too big, I played blackjack, the dealer was very rude to people, sorry George you should find a different job. This hotel is in a very good location, not to noisy like the middle of the strip. I would stay here again.	3	5	-1	4	4	5	-1	5

I have stayed here before all be it before the high resort fee was introduced and I must say it was a rip off. Anyone can print off their boarding passes. Vouchers for drinks have conditions on them and who uses the gym on holiday. I would look around other hotel prices next time. Gilleys bar was great, staff friendly and great promotions on drinks. Shopping at the outlet malls was more expensive this year but there are still bargains to be had. Saw Rod Stewart at Caesars and can recommend the show. It was great to see someone who genuinely wanted to be there and entertain us. Gladys Knight was also excellent. Vegas is still a fantastic place to go although it can get crowded at the weekends. You don't have to gamble all the time there is plenty to do.	3	5	-1	3	4	4	-1	-1

Is it the hottest, coolest or best hotel in Vegas? Probably not but it was a great value and was perfect for our group. We spent as much time in/around the pool as anywhere and it was a fun and friendly environment with great service. I'm not a big gambler but the rollers in our group seemed more than happy. I did hit the poker room- which has been there for years- and had a good time loosing my money. We ate a few meals, nothing spectacular but reasonable prices and a good value. Room was clean, well appointed and the staff were generally quite friendly. I'm not into shows but the folks I ran into that went to the Cirque show gave rave reviews.	4	3	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

No need to wait for lifts we had our own set for the upper floors, which were activated with your room key card, some times they worked, sometimes no.Very dim lighting in the room even with all the lighting on, wonder why?<br/>I don't think the staff had been shown the art of using a vaccuum cleaner. The carpet and skirting area were in a filthy condition, Rubbish that was on the floor when we arrived was still there when we left. Waiting to welcome the next guests.<br/>In the bathroom ther were drops of fluid of unknown origin that had dried in on the floor. Human hair was stuck to the shower wall, wrong colour to belong to us, it had been there for quite a while.<br/>We wondered why when each time we came back to our rooms the plug in the hand basin and bath had been put back in the plug holes. After removing one and having a sniff we soon realised, why. Being on the 36th floor you would not have expected a smell like this. The plug was returned to its home.	1	3	-1	1	1	3	-1	2

We stayed in a front room on 12th floor. The nightly show out the front did not finish until 11.45 and contained loud bangs and fireworks. Sleeping before midnight was not an option! <br/>The room was fairly clean but we found plastic bags in the drawers left by previous guests.<br/>Bed was comfortable. Next morning I received a message that the valet parking had damaged my car. We were given a 2 for 1 voucher for the buffet but had to wait in line for 45 minutes. The buffet was very good.

The rooms were renovated a few years ago and still look good, the bed was comfy, nice bathroom, absolutely no issues with the room. Appreciated the big safe (big enough for my laptop) and the easy to reach elec outlets.<br/><br/>The hotel charges a resort fee of $20/night. Seems like a lot but it includes free wifi, daily newspaper, access to fitness center, coupons and more. Considering most hotels charge about $15/day for wifi, it isn't that bad. Even with the resort fee added in, TI was still a good value.<br/><br/>We had a rental car and TI's location has easy access from the highway. Neighbors within walking distance include Fashion Show Mall, Wynn, Palazzo, Venetian, Mirage and our favorite Casino Royale, plus all the shops and restaurants at those places. Don't forget to check out Tix4Tonite at FS Mall for cheap show tix.<br/><br/>TI is not as huge as some other resorts so it's easy to get around.

Bathroom lighting is a little dark also. <br/><br/>Tried the dinner buffet. Nothing great but hotel provided a 2 for 1 coupon with the resort fee.

I got in on a sweet deal some months ago...now I know why; hurting for business I presume.

We had a corner, strip view room on the 30th floor which was awesome, great view of the Venetian and the strip. The room was a good size and a large bathroom, the bed was very comfortable and the room was very quiet. The best part of TI is the location, close to the Fashion Show Mall, the Palazzo and the Mirage. The casino isn't all that exciting but for the price and location we couldn't complain. The drinks at Kahuanville are great &amp; strong with friendly bartenders, also enjoyed having drinks at the Isla Mexican Bar. We stopped by Giley's on afternoon and had the rudest bartender, he yelled at us for trying to use the &quot;wrong&quot; coupon for discount drinks that the hotel provided us. That was our only bad experience and will never go back to that bar again. Also the Starbucks on site is much more expensive than normal Starbucks but if you go to the one across the street at Fashion Show Mall it is the normal prices.	4	4	-1	4	4	3	-1	5

The first time it took over 40 minutes to check-in, the first room they gave us was dirty and the second room was an adjoining one, right next to people with a small child. NOISY as the kid kept opening and slamming the adjoining door at all hours of the day and night! The plumbing was so bad that a foul odor was emanating from the bathroom sink and the toilet barely flushed. The place was CRAWLING with kids and they were even censoring the music played over the casino speakers! The final straw was the horrible service in the cafe. <br/><br/>We wrote and advised of the issues and were offered a bundle to come back: private check-in, upgrade to a huge suite, VIP status for our stay, $300 in resort credits and even $100 in casino credits. So, we begrudgingly went back. BIG MISTAKE!<br/><br/>The private check-in was nice, but you still have to trek through the casino from the parking structure and, once again, it was wall-to-wall kids. UGH. Then, the suite was big, but the ceiling was water-stained, the TV did not work, the halls were LOUD, the same food tray sat in the hall for days, and overall, the place was just filthy. The worst thing was when the maid walked in without knocking and when I walked into the living room to stop her, she apologized and turned to leave. I turned around and went back into the bedroom and she followed me in just to hand me soap! Why is this bad? Well, my husband was not dressed! Thankfully, he ducked into the bathroom, but she should have never just barged in like that!!!<br/><br/>Oh, and once again, the cafe service was HORRIBLE - so much so that after waiting 30 minutes to give our order, we walked over to the Palazzo and PAID to eat at the cafe there! In fact, even after all was said and done, we did not use our entire resort credit at TI because we could not stand to be there any longer! Even Kahunaville's waitresses were uncaring and rude.<br/><br/>The absolute final straw was in the casino when a machine malfunctioned and I lost $20. The casino staff could have cared less. So much for being a VIP guest!<br/><br/>We will NEVER go back!!!	3	4	-1	1	2	2	-1	3

Rooms were not new but it was clean with enough room. Absolutely nice to have been given a room at a higher floor. Many shops, shows and restaurants were accessible both within and outside of the hotel. It was not difficult to get a cab since because of the hotel's location.<br/>I stayed on Nov 2008.	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

The room was spacious and the bed was divine, the bathtub was heaven, (I am 6 feet tall and not a string bean), and I could almost float in the tub. <br/><br/>The food in the buffet on the casino floor was delicious and plentiful, there was a large variety and the service was flawless. The area was situated so the noise of the casino floor was not intrusive. I did not have an opportunity to check out the other in-house restaurants. <br/><br/>The staff was extremely helpful finding and buying tickets to other venues and the entertainment in front of the hotel, &quot;The sirens of 'ti&quot;, while a little silly, was amusing. I would recommend no room facing the boulevard lower than the sixth floor because the show is every half hour and can being noisy. <br/>Tthis was my first trip to Vegas and it wasn't a bad experience but I have nothing else to compare it to. For the price, it was fun and I would go back.	4	4	-1	5	4	4	-1	-1

It was a fun trip, and I would generally recommend this hotel. It?? location is fairly nice, across the strip from the Wynn and Encore, and right next to the Mirage &amp; the fashion show mall. The room was nice, nothing spectacular, but clean, comfortable and quite. My full room review is in video on youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMJRpa3E7QE .<br/>The pool area is rather small, but works. You have to show your room card to get into the pool area. There are plenty of loungers, and they offer free beach towels while you are there. There is bar outside and they have snacks available for purchase. The pool is small, and not deep, but fine to cool off, and have fun times in. There is hot tub next to pool, its big enough for probably 10 people comfortably, and 20 partiers. The hot tub was really nice, the bubbles were really relaxing on my back.<br/>There are a number of places to eat and snack at TI. At check in, I received to free passes for the TI buffet that were only good for lunch or supper. I was not impressed with the TI buffet for supper, and wouldn?? suggest paying for it, there are much better options on the strip. However, the breakfast buffet is very good. Throughout the day they have ladies giving out coupons for Kahunaville. One of the coupons is for an $8.99 breakfast, two eggs, choice of meat, hashbrowns and toast, a great deal, and tasty, highly recommended. The resort also highly promotes the Gilly?? Bar &amp; Grill. I went there for supper once, and had baby back ribs, it was pretty good. It?? a country bar, and they live it up in there. I like country music, and I liked the clothing the ladies wore, short tight shorts, and short shirts, very nice. There is a pizza place on the way to the pool, just past the poker room. I didn?? think the pizza was all that good, but made for a quick lunch, and it wasn?? that bad either.<br/>The casino itself is pretty nice, lots of video poker, slots of all types, and various table games. The cocktail waitresses generally seemed to be around and when I was ready for a drink, they were close by. The poker room is a small area; they have about 4 daily Texas-hold??m tournaments with a $50 buy in. They also had a cash game going most afternoons and evenings. They also have a Gilly?? table game area where in the later evenings they have ??illy?? Girls?in scantily clad clothing dealing games, a nice show.<br/>I did a few things off resort. I had lunch one day at Stripburger, it?? located on the other side of the fashion show mall. A truly awesome burger, with fresh fries and a milkshake, a nice way to forget about air travel. They have outdoor and indoor seating, it?? right on an intersection on the strip, so it can be a bit loud, but didn?? bother me. I also saw a show at the Improv in Harrah?? Casiono, and X-Burlesque at the Flamingo. The Improv show featured three comics and a comedic host, most of it was good stuff, some not so much. Worth a go if you like comedy, and fairly cheap. X-Burlesque is a good adult ?topless show. I don?? like how the theater is arrainged. The audience faces a pole stage, with the main stage to the side. Hello sore neck after the show. They have professional dancers so you get a fairly classy show, just topless. I enjoyed it. I played slots in each casino mentioned, Harrah?? is really good, Flamingo, less so, and very confusing to get around in.	4	3	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

We have been to Vegas many times before and stayed in many of the themed hotels (MGM, Bellagio, Caesars Palace, etc) and would definatly stay here again! The price was great as was the location on the strip, it's located oposite the Venetian and next to the Fashion mall so getting the Express buses to the outlets could not be easier. Check in was quick and easy and our room, a standard, was on the 28th floor had amazing views of the strip. The room was cleana nd well decorated and the bed was so comfortable (which I don't usually find in the US,) and I'd have happily swapped it for our bed at home and the bath was huge (again unusal in the US). We couldn't fault this and normally stay in 5* and with this being only a 4* it surpassed our expections, we would definatly stay here again and take over some of the more expensive hotels (which are overpriced with tiny rooms just because of the name), as had a great stay! FYI we didn't see any kids in the hotel as I've seen other reviews saying it was over-run with them, it wasn't!	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

The location for us was perfect, the walkway to the mall and across LVBlvd was a quick way to get around. Walgreens is across the street, many food choices within an easy walk if you don't want to eat at the hotel. Check-in was quick, Sunday at 2pm, took about 10 minutes and staff were friendly. The rooms were fine, yes a few furniture nicks here and there but for what we paid, we had no complaints and they were clean. There were 4 of us in 2 adjoining rooms, we have mixed reviews on the beds...I thought they were great :) We ate at the buffet, Kahunaville, the Coffee Shop and Canters Deli. Food was average, nothing spectacular, albeit expensive. The resort fee is a hard one to take, we used the 2 for one drink coupons, the internet daily and I printed off our boarding passes, I knew this going in and just added it into the cost of the room. It is what it is. The parking garage was never full, the walk into the hotel was not too bad, getting in and out was easy, freeway access right off the road. The biggest complaint for us was the smoke filled casino, yes I know it's Vegas, but it did not matter what time of day, as soon as you got off the elevator wham.....it was like walking into a wall of smoke. The ventilation system must be poor in this particular hotel, we were in several different casino's and did not notice the smell as bad. All in all if you get a good rate and are not expecting a 5star hotel (and can handle a smoky casino) I would say you would find TI a good choice.	5	5	-1	3	4	4	-1	4

A good location, right in the centre of the strip. This time we chose a regular room with a strip view. We had gotten a special rate on their website that came with two buffet meals, plus another two for one and other stuff. There is a $20 &quot;resort fee&quot; per day here, an annoyance, since the only thing that I got out of it was the included internet, which did work in the rooms.I tried it in the casino from my iPhone, but it did not work. I guess they want you to concentrate on gambling.<br/><br/>There was a long line up at the check in and I had a fit - but it went very quickly - among the best that I had seen on the strip. Normal check in was 3PM, which is when we arrived - but there was a sign saying that they were allowing 10AM check ins. You should check that if the earlier time is better for you. <br/><br/>I have no hesitation in suggesting you stay here - if the location fits your need. We have stayed at most of the hotels on the strip. This is not our favorite, I think we like Venetian more, but the price this time was too high there.	4	4	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

We were at the end of the hall, so very quiet. The location of TI is great which is always a huge plus for us. Staff all friendly and helpful. <br/><br/>Our mid-week package (I am on their internet mailing list) was priced very well and included four dinner buffets. Not being a buffet person I was a bit apprehensive, but this buffet was great as they had stations where food was prepared for you, including wonderful salads and pasta cooked to order. <br/><br/>TI is a great hotel and an excellent value, We would highly recommend it!	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

I am so unstatisfied with the service, the clock in our room is the wrong time and I called the front desk to ask them how to reset it (its not a simple alarm clock) and they gave me instructions that were wrong. I told them thats not the type of clock that I have and she blew me off and was completely rude. She said they could have the tech guy come into our room to reset our clock, with a complete attitude.

Outside the window were the air conditioning units which were a constant noise but my husband and I were too tired to kick up a stink and ask to be moved but when the A/C stopped working in our room we called the Front Desk and they sent up an &quot;Engineer&quot; to have a look at the wall panel control. He couldn't fix it so he called down to the Front Desk and said that these people cannot stay in this room as the A/C is not working and would have to be moved. It turned out not to be a bad thing as we got moved to the 35th floor (36 floors in the building) overlooking Las Vegas Blvd. with its spectacular views of The Strip. The buffet in the hotel is excellent. If you get the 2 for 1 buffet tickets in your hotel package, this sure makes the buffet very affordable.	4	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

Check in was speedy and friendly. Rooms were clean and updated, beds comfy, towels scratchy. (stayed on 22nd floor). Wouldn't pay the upcharge for a stripview room again as we had to stretch our necks to see it. <br/><br/>Upon check-in we were given coupons for two-for-one drinks at the casino bar as well as Kahunaville. One evening another couple we were with tried to use them at the casino Breezes bar for two margaritas. They were told they could use them for any drink up to $9.50. They received two margaritas for that amount. The very next evening I decided to use mine for two margaritas and the price was $11.50. The same thing happened with a discrepancy at Kahunaville the next evening. I guess it depends on who you get as a bartender. Although the service on the casino floor was great, I really felt nickle-and-dimed between the drink prices and the resort fees. Also....tip for buying your morning coffee....the coffee in the casino Coffee Shop is horrible and bitter!!! The Starbucks in the hotel as well as in the front of it charges $3.85 for a regular grande BUT the Starbucks right in front of the Fashion Show Mall one block away was $2.65 for the same size! Would stay elsewhere next time.	3	4	-1	4	4	3	-1	4

When we checked in we were told that our &quot;resort fee&quot; would be free of charge but when we checked out we realized we had been charged daily for it. When we brought this to the attention of the manager at the check out desk she treated us very poorly, didn't apologize for her employee's mistake and proceeded to tell us that we wouldn't get this deal on any hotel on the strip never mind at TI. Very rude! All we did was use the internet and they charged a fee of 20$ a day. After about a half hour of trying to get her to understand that this was their fault she finally offered to only charge us for half the fee. What a rip off!! And to be treated like just a number!

So we booked the Treasure Island at very short notice.<br/><br/>What a lovely surprise. We thought that the cost of the hotel (very reasonable), plus the fact that it is situated on the Strip would mean dirty cramped and noisy rooms. But no, not at all. Fantastically comfy beds, very clean and cool bedroom, excellent powerful shower and bath (and lovely toiletries), great facilities including breakfast and buffet lunch.....yum!!! An absolute bargain!!<br/>Topped off by the TI show in the evening....wow get there early to ensure a good spot, as this is a popular destination by people throughout vegas.

The pillows were surprisingly better than I expected too. <br/><br/>With my hotel rate, I also got 2 buffet tickets.

Just before we went we read a few reports on trip advisor saying the hotel needed a lot of repair and was on the way downhill - but don't believe them. The bed was super comfortable as well.

I stayed during the week...I try to avoid weekends in Vegas. I really enjoyed my stay and I had a GREAT room. If possible, book a petite suite. It's approximately 650s.f. and comes with two full (huge) bathrooms. One has a 2-person jacuzzi tub and the other has a large walk-in shower. This suite comes with king size bed only, but the couch is a pull out bed if you need it. My room was absolutely spotless. Overall the hotel was very clean &amp; well maintained. I used the spa which was great and rented a cabana at the pool. It was well worth it...not excessive $$$ during the week. My only gripe was that check-in was a bit slow, but that is a minor speed bump considering the rest of the stay was good. Dined at the upscale steak house (Phil's) and while a bit pricey the food and service were top notch. The hotel is in a great location on the strip. This property is owned by an individual (Phil Ruffin) so it is not part of the mega-corporations which have taken over Vegas. There still seems to be real attention to detail at this hotel.

Rooms were very clean and beds were great! Hotel resort fee I thought was high - $20 per day which gives free wireless Internet, access to exercise room, one 2 for 1 buffet voucher &amp; a couple other minor items. Having said that, the per night rates were very good so the overall cost was reasonable. Also, I had found a lower promotion on the Internet and the TI staff had no problem giving me the lower rate. The buffet was good- what you'd usually expect variety and taste wise. I don't usually gamble much because I tend to lose so fast that there's no fun in it but I found I actually got more play time in the TI casino and one day actually even won some money. Tried other casinos but kept coming back to TI. Only downfall is the amount of smoke; it definitely could use better ventilation. Overall good hotel and would stay again.	4	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

Tonnes of options for all different kinds of eaters!	4	4	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

Was on the 30-something floor and the express elevator to the upper floors was super convenient. Surprised to open the room door and be looking directly at the strip. What a view! Had no idea a $41 room would could be so great! We appreciate the security check at the elevators. No room key, no elevator access.<br/><br/>TI is in a great north strip locale. So much to do/see within walking distance. Plenty of dining/shopping options without stepping outside.<br/><br/>Taxi to TI from LAS was about $30 with tip. This was the quick, non-strip route, though we hit nearly every red light at 11pm.	5	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	4

The room was tired looking bathroom was large but dark couldnt see to put on makeup. The beds comfortable the view was spectacular. We were in Las Vegas for 4th July so it was super busy. The hotel seemed to have alot of younger guests. My husband and I are in our late 40s. The pool was like a dance party and you couldnt move let alone have dip for all the young ones dancing and drinking. Overall it was ok place to stay maybe one of the classier hotels might be better. We had a look around and some of the other hotels were better such as the Bellagio	3	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

The room was decent looked as what was expected. Bed was comfy, room simple and clean. The bathroom was a turn off however. It was a little dark not very well lit, the shower area in the bathrom was a little dirty with some visible brown spots not sure from what. The towels need badly to be replaced, they were dingy to say the least. Parking was easy to access, plentiful and free. The short encounter we had with the staff was pleasant. The siren show was fun to watch, they also offered a cirque show which we did not attend. Over all it was a pleasant stay, I just wished the bathroom were a little more tended to. I am however still on the fence if I would return here again for a future stay.	4	4	-1	3	3	4	-1	5

Arrived on Wed. evening to an empty check-in line. Upgraded to a 35th floor strip-view room without even asking. Room was lovely with large bathroom, comfortable beds and a tub that was perfect for leisurely soaks. Really enjoyed the buffet that was offered as part of the package. Ti is very conveniently located on the strip,with the Fashion Store mall located across the street with direct access,Sarbucks and a large Walgreens across the road. Venetian and Harrahs also across the street and Mirage next door, with Caesars and Bellagio in easy walking distance. If you plan on driving, the freeway access is right behind the hotel making it easy to get away from the strip when its busy.<br/>Really glad we were there mid-week as it was so much busier come the weekend. casino was smoky but so were all the casinos we visited especially on the weekend.<br/>Direct access to Mirage next door via the tram was nice, especially if you don't want to carry a coat with you. Saw the Terry Fater show and Love at the Mirage, both of which were excellent <br/><br/>Wouldn't hesitate to go back to TI, preferring it's relaxed venue to the more upscale Bellagio.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

The room itself was lovely and the bathroom surprisingly spacious with shower over a sit-bath. There is a (empty) fridge and safe in the room. When the light went out in the bathroom, someone came up really quickly to fix it. The staff were friendly and efficient. Lots of reviews say the place looks tired- maybe the outside signage, but the inside looked in good condition to me (much better than I expected from the reviews). I'm sure it is nothing on the fancy 5* places on the strip, but it really depends what you want out of your trip.<br/><br/>In terms of facilities, Isla restaurant on site was good although a bit expensive. We didn't try Phils Steakhouse. The lunch buffet was free with coupons we received at check in, and worthwhile for that reason: there was a good range of savoury and sweet food although not to my taste. That said, it was free and there were plenty of people enjoying themselves there. The pool and hot tub opened at 8.30 ish although it wasn't really pool weather in November!<br/><br/>The location is central strip and really can't be bettered. There is a Starbucks right outside the hotel for quick breakfasts and coffee. Buses stop almost right outside the hotel and there is no shortage of taxis! <br/><br/>The price we got for this was very reasonable- this stay was very good value for money. Beware resort fees! Our agent told us this was included for us, but it turns out it wasn't. The internet access we used therefore turned out to be surprisingly expensive! The check out staff turned this into 4 nights of resort fees, which was marginally cheaper. I gather these ridiculous fees aren't confined to TI though, and are even higher in some hotels on the strip.	4	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

It was my first trip to Vegas so I really don't have much to compare it to but I definitely have no complaints. When we arrived the line to check in looked like an airport line. There were at least 40 people in front of us so we asked the bellman to hold our bags and we went for something to eat at Isla, the Mexican restaurant in the resort. Turned out to be a good move because there was no line when we returned. Rooms are clean, average sized. Nice bathroom. I saw one reviewer mentioned they had a small fridge, we did not and I missed having one. <br/>The location is good, kind of in the middle of the strip. There is a resort fee, 25 a day, so factor that into your price. It was too cold when we were there to swim but the pool looked fantastic. I would stay there again if I went back and recommend it to others.	4	5	-1	4	5	5	-1	5

We stayed in a strip view room for 4 nights and the view of the strip is amazing. You can see all the lights at night all the way till Mandalay Bay. The room was very modern and spacious and the bed is just amazing. You would never want to get out of it once you're in it. All the facilities is very good. The buffet restaurant is amazing and there are starbucks and nice bars inside the hotel. We were able to check in 10AM in the morning and there no line at all. The staffs were friendly and very helpful. You have to pay the resort fees per night but its well worth it becasue of the reasonable hotel price we booked from hotels.com. The location is best on the strip right opposite the venetian and next to mirage. Also the hotel is connected to the Fashion Mall. There are no negatives concerning this Hotel.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

This time, we came with our teenage daughters for 3 nights. <br/><br/>Check in was a problem: they were not able to accomodate our request for connecting rooms (request was made many months earlier), only one room was available by check-in time at 3pm (despite the sign at the front desk stating that they were checking in early at 11am), and when we finally got our second room several hours later, I was &quot;assisted&quot; by a front-desk employee who told me that our credit card was denied for the room payment. Instead of asking for my card or using the card that I checked in with for the first room (I later found out) she was trying to use the card # I had made the reservations with months earlier, the number of which had been stolen, and we had been issued new cards. At least the manager on duty agreed to reinburse our account for a token amount for my inconvenience.<br/><br/>The rooms were nicely redecorated and clean, the beds were very comfortable, housekeeping was fine, noise level was high (we had strip view rooms), internet service was spotty, the new policy &quot;resort fee&quot; includes fitness room access, newspaper, internet, &amp; local phone calls.<br/><br/>We had good breakfasts at the Coffee House, the Buffet and at Kahunaville. I took the family to Cirque du Soliel - Mystere, which was as great as I remembered. Location is primo if you are into shopping: walkway right to Fashion Show Mall, across the strip from Venetian &amp; Grand Canal Shops, and two resorts away from the Caeser's Forum Shops.<br/><br/>Overall, a decent but flawed stay. When we return with the teens, we will probably try somewhere different.	5	5	-1	4	4	2	-1	3

However the resort fee took us by surprise, and it did seem a bit much for facilities we didnt intend to use, but then it wasn't excessive.<br/>Room was lovely, clean and modern and we were lucky enough to get a strip view and could watch the Mirage Volcano erupt from our window.<br/>The whole place has a younger atmosphere and makes it a lot more lively, not so much the boozed up hardcore gamblers you find at the other places.<br/>Kahunaville is the place to eat, especially breakfast. Good value, nice food and the staff were very polite and friendly. We tried the cocktails at night and the oxygen bar, well worth a visit. <br/>Don't bother with the VIP spot for the pirate show, you're miles from the action and can barely see, get there early and get a place by the ropes.	4	4	-1	5	5	4	-1	-1

Very satisfied with hotel overall and would definately stay again! Hotel staff were friendly, rooms very clean and beds very comfortable with lots of pillows. We stayed on the 7th floor and had a great view of the strip. You could see that our room was a little worn with a stain on the bathroom counter, a shower that drained very slowly and nicks to some furniture, room was not overly large but well-appointed. No coffee maker but we did have a fridge and safe which was nice. Biggest complaint was a long (1 hr.) wait to check in up on arrival and only about 4 desk clerks to handle all those people. This was our first trip to Vegas but we would definately stay at TI again. For the price we paid, it was a great fit for us!	4	5	-1	3	4	4	-1	5

We requested the suite, facing the Strip. Great view. However, the room was less than mediocre. The room was plain with no fancy decor. It had the basic extra large room, jacuzzi, and 2 bath. We had to call in for wine glasses and was told that we would get charged f we took it with us (did they think we were going to steal it!!!). Then realized it did NOT have wine openers in the room (it was one of those pocket wine openers). No ice bucket. NO bath robes, NO slippers. <br/><br/>We only got $10.00 worth of casino credit. When we activated it, the worker said that's all we get even though we told her we stayed at the suite and paid a gang of money to stay in their expensive room.<br/><br/>Overall, if one plans to stay in a suite room, book elsewhere! This hotel sucks. I have stayed in the Venetian, Bellagio and NY, NY...way better Suites than TI.	2	4	-1	2	3	3	-1	3

I think I slept so well there. Too bad we were in Vegas, we didn't sleep that much. We stayed pretty high up in the towers, the view was great. We overlooked the little lake with the boat and show. It was loud only a couple of times, but that was because we happened to be in our room at the time. We normally wouldn't have been in at the times the shows were playing. The staff is very accomodating, and responded well when we needed a change in pillows. The buffet is rated very high and we loved the variety of food. Honestly, what was even better was the quality. One of the best quality buffets in vegas we went to. The coffee shop is 24 hours but is very overpriced. Food was good at 2 in the morning though. If you are looking for a great pool atmosphere, it is nice but the size is one of the smaller ones for a big hotel in the city. With the show outside, and just the vibe of the hotel, I probably wouldn't recommend this be a place that you would bring family. Overall, plan on staying there the next time we go.	4	3	-1	5	4	5	-1	5

Had to make three requests and the problem still was not fixed on checkout after two nights. No coffee making facilities. Aircon, beds and bathroom OK. Additional &quot;resort fee&quot; charges are a rip off, we did not use any of the services that it is supposed to cover. Note that there are other resorts / hotels that do not levy this extra charge (eg Caesars Palace, Planet Hollywood, Paris, Flamingo). The casino and restaurants are dark and dingy. Overall I'd recommend going elsewhere.	2	4	-1	2	3	1	-1	3

It is located on one end of the strip and very close to the Fashion mall. What I liked about TI is the walk from the room to the elevators, street or parking garage. You do a lot of walking in Vegas and the last thing you want is a long walk from your car or street to your hotel room. The staff was very courteous. The rooms were nice. We had a strip view room. the windows are small, but the view is absolutely breath taking.

A hotel on the strip should be staffed appropriately to accommodate the large number of people arriving to their resort. There were multiple check in stations that were not staffed. This was not a one time occurrence, as we walked by other times during our stay, there was always a line. We did not witness this at any of the other hotels we visited. The night before we were leaving we called the front desk to ask what time check out was, and we were told it was 11 AM. We asked if we would be able to check out an hour later, but were told they could not accommodate our request. You would think after making us wait an hour to check in they could have let us check out an hour later. Then as we were leaving our room to check out, we noticed that a sign in the room stated check out is at noon. When we inquired why we were told 11 AM when the sign in the room says noon, we were told the check out time is different depending on the time of year. Whether checking in or out, it appeared the staff was more concerned about what best accommodated them and their time schedule than their guest's. Before our stay we had also tried to request that our room be next to or on the same floor as the other couple we were traveling with. We were told that this could not be guaranteed in advance, but that we would have to make this request upon check in. They were able to get us rooms on the same floor at check in, but it is ridiculous that they could not give us the piece of mind of fulfilling this request prior to our checking in. Other than the issues mentioned above, the rooms were clean and comfortable, the lunch buffet at the hotel was very good, and the casino is fine, but not one of the better ones, and had worse ventilation than others. We had a room with a very nice view of the strip. If you want a hotel offering the service expected in Las Vegas, choose another hotel.	3	4	-1	4	5	1	-1	3

We spent this last Thanksgiving weekend with my mother and our 2 kids (10 and 12). We don't usually take our kids to Las Vegas, but because we were meeting out-of-town relatives we decided to take them along. Check-in went smoothly. The rooms are nice, but could only rate it a 3 because our bed squeeked, my mother saw a small roach run across her pillow (it must have hitched a ride with the linens because the rooms are super clean), the time on the clock radio was off and wasn't user friendly to adjust it. There are safes and small refrigerators in the rooms, which is nice. The location is nice (next to Mirage and across from Palazzio and Venetian). The Siren show was a disappointment. It was much better without the seductive pole dancers. Also not comfortable playing cards with bikini girl card dealers. Some hotels have food courts, nice for a quick bite if you are on the run (especially with kids). This one does not. Again, Vegas isn't really a place for kids....but if you do take them, there are other hotels more accommodating. There is a small arcade way in the back by Starbucks, but it's nothing to write home about. If you have a family and stay here, you can walk north about 10 minutes to Circus Circus for kids' entertainment (just visit - not stay). Otherwise, this is a nice hotel with nice rooms for the most part, but when you factor in the resort fee of $20+, expensive for the reasons stated above.	3	4	-1	4	4	5	-1	3

We stayed at Treasure Island when it first opened and visited it's casino over the past 16 years. We arrived early and checked in by a fellow named Christian who was very pleasant and made us feel welcomed. We were given a great room that overlooked the Las Vegas strip. We thought it might be noisy but it wasn't and we actually got to see the Sirens pirate show in front of the hotel from our room (Note: If you're a guest at the hotel, they're is a section you can watch the show for hotel guests only. Ask the concierge or hotel security for it's location). <br/><br/>The room had a great view, quiet, and was very comfortable. The bed was great and we enjoyed our entire stay. The buffett was busy but the food selection was just fine. We tried their asian &quot;Pho&quot; restaurant and found it was actually more to our liking being low salt/low fat selections.<br/><br/>The hotel location was fantastic.

Check-in took about 30 mins but was smooth and efficient. The room was very comfortable but not as large as others I've stayed in such as the Hilton, Tropicana, MGM Grand, etc. I was also disappointed not to have a Strip or pool view and instead, was given a view of the Trump hotel - not the best. I did complain but was told that all rooms were already allocated. The casino has a great atmosphere and the pool area was clean and well organised, however, space is a little limited and parts soon become shaded after lunchtime, I found. Overall, a pleasant stay and one I would recommend to anyone looking for a good hotel on The Strip.	4	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

In the past we always stayed at Luxor or Mandalay bay. We had a corner room with a strip view. the room was ok, the bed was very nice. The casino was very smokey and small. Thanksgiving night we came back to the hotel very late after the Penn &amp; Teller show. The hotel was very quiet. <br/>On Friday night we noticed the Christmas music from outside but didn't think about it since we had the TV on. The music would come on every hour for about 20 minutes we didn't know from where. After a long day my wife went to sleep at 9PM and woke at 9:30 telling me to turn down the TV, the TV was off.<br/>I called the desk they said the music stopped at 10:30pm. When I went to sleep the same thing happened, it was loud enough to wake you from a deep sleep. We where on the 23rd floor. <br/>I went to the desk and they said they didn't know about the music, then she said it was from the Mirrage. After calling the manager she said it was the Venetian and it would go on until 11:30pm.<br/>They decided to change us to the back of the building, even tho we paid for a strip view. How about telling the Venetian to tone it down. Would they get away with this at 6AM when all the kids are coming back from the clubs.<br/>Everything about the place needed work, not enough desk help or valets. The coffee shop was a big waste of money. Very overpriced no selection and poor service. We saw a customer complaining to a manager, when the customer left the manager made fun of the customer. The lady was right, it was the worst bacon on the planet. You could have had a turkey dinner for $58. Maybe the bird was imported. <br/>Next time back to Mandalay Bay. It least its worth the high prices. Also when you have a room charge account TI automatically charges you $100 a day to your credit card.	2	1	-1	3	3	2	-1	1

Hotel in a central location. Neighbor shopping center, there is a bridge with the to. We were well furnished rooms, but small. We stayed on the 34. floor, but the elevators are fast ... Show in front of the hotel attracts the attention of many people ...<br/><br/>No coffee making facilities in room, television channels, limited ...

We stayed here in January, and noticed a huge decline in the condition of the hotel, the service and the sheer lack of employees. Our room was nice, but the overall hotel experience was lacking. It used to be such a fun tropical place to visit that actually had a theme. Now it doesn't seem to have one. There's an Irish pub with not so hot girls dancing around on the tables, and several restaurants that seem to be catering to Asian visitors. The Siren thing out front was trashy and steotypical - used to love watching the real pirates and englishmen! <br/>Sadly, despite all of our good memories, we won't be staying here again.	3	3	-1	3	2	2	-1	3

The location was great, right by the Venetian, Wynn, Encore, Mirage, Palazzo and Caesars (basically the modern end of the strip, dont be fooled by great deals down at the other end where planet hollywood is). Also next to the fashion mall. <br/><br/>The rooms were amazing. They were spacious and comfy with big beds and a nice view of the strip. They were extremely clean (to start with).<br/><br/>Now fo the bad points: The hotel is a dive, its old and run down with old machines and staff from hell. They were all rude (apart from the friendly bar staff) and one woman (Asian) dealer always got angry when we played for no reason. Our room was left 2 days without being cleaned, again, for no reason and no one ever told us about a ridiculous gym fee before booking.<br/><br/>If you want to stay somewhere nice, spend a little more and stay in the Wynn or Venetian. Otherwise, this is ok but not the best hotel in the world. For location its good which is why I gave 3/5.	5	5	-1	4	3	1	-1	5

We arrived at 11:00am on Saturday went to invited check in and received a complimentary upgrade to a Petite Suite 39002 - best view of the strip we have ever seen. What a nice surprise and the room was clean, yes some of the furniture had some chips on them - but nothing to make us want to change rooms. Beds, were very comfortable and bathrooms (we had 2) were spotless. We ate 2 meals at Cantors Deli - fabulous food, large sandwiches which you can easily share with another individual.<br/><br/>Casino - we found all the slot machines we wanted to play and did well this year with payouts. We saw alot of people hitting rather large payouts on the machines on Saturday and Sunday night when we were playing. <br/><br/>We like the location as it is so convienent to everything.<br/><br/>In all we would return to the property again, I do agree that the hotel needs a major face lift. <br/><br/>We took my brother and niece on this trip (Vegas Virgins) and their comment was the hotel looked dingy compared to the other properties in the area - ie Venetian, Mirage, Encore, Wynn. I know its an older hotel, but just wanted to add their comments.<br/><br/>Would we return, yes!	4	5	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

I actually argued to have my charges removed because our room was never cleaned and my gf couldn't gain wireless access the entire stay. Loud rowdy younger crowd by the pool and if you want to rent a cabana make sure you do it ahead of time bc they were booked the entire time we were there. Not so good...not so bad.

It's right across from the Venetian and Palazzo and Cesar's Palace and the Fashion Center on either side. Lost of shopping to be had here. The rooms are newly remodeled, with comfy beds. We slept well both nights. We didn't get to check out any pools since we came in November. <br/><br/>We also got a two-for-one cocktail voucher that we used at the Kalhua/Kalihuana Bar (or however you spell it) for two margaritas. They gave us an extra shot of tequila to add to the margaritas, which was a great way to get the night started!<br/><br/>We also gave the buffet a try, pretty decent food and they provide mimosas in a high ball glass! <br/><br/>The cons: If you are looking for a good party scene, this may not be it. There were definitely a lot more families here. They are also remodeling the club there, so that may have also contributed to the lack of &quot;party.&quot; And there wasn't much by way of a fine food scene. On the bright side, they do have a Canter's Delicatessen... yum!! <br/><br/>The ceilings are a little lower compared to some of the other newer hotels like Aria or Wynn, so you can still smell the cigarettes... but it's nothing compared to some of the other hotels like Harrah's, where you run the risk of contracting lung cancer while walking though the casino. My last &quot;complaint&quot; - there weren't any robes provided in the room. No biggie, just an FYI.<br/><br/>I would stay here again, knowing that I have to leave the hotel to find the food and party scene.	4	5	-1	4	5	3	-1	4

Must be clean, free of bugs and smoke free. This hotel fit the bill perfectly!! This was my first Vegas trip and I must say TI contributed to an absolutely wonderful time. Check-in took quite a long time; however, we made it through...watching all the glitz and people made it pass quickly. Absolutely loved the modern updated room, very clean and NO SMOKE odor at all!! How they do that in a casino is beyond me! Room was a bit small, but again who spends waking hours in their room in Vegas??? <br/><br/>As in most Vegas hotels - no coffee maker....for those of us that MUST have coffee in the AM and don't want to trudge down to casino restaurant in our PJ's &amp; pay $5/cup....I took a small hot pot (5.99 @ CVS/Walgreens etc) in my checked bags and Starbucks Viva.

Deals can be found, but you really have to look for them. The cheap coupon for breakfast at the Hawaiian restaurant in the mall, is good but you really have to choke down the pre-cooked (by at least a day) eggs, toast and bacon.<br/>The casino is not bad, but if you want my advise don?? get the TI card as they monitor your spending as they want you to insert it in every slot and card machine. I think they use it to decide whether you have won enough money. We won more by not using the card and just cashing out a ticket and not using the tickets in the machines once they pay out.<br/>Room service was excellent. security was good, the hotel is central in Vegas and has good access to cabs and such. Its fairly close to the airport. Staff at the check in/out are good, no problems there. The desk where you book trips, skip it, they don?? do deals there or know what all the trips are about, they just staff it. The best deals for trips and shows are found on the street out in front of the TI Sirens show??sk for Keith or Dawna or Sean. The best deals for the shows is go out to the booths in front of the hotels about 1 hour before the show?/2 to ?off.	3	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	4

We liked the room and the excellent strip view. Many other casinos are within easy walking distance.<br/><br/>We had breakfast once at the Kahunaville restaurant, which we wouldn't recommend. You get about the same at Denny's for much less. Dinner at pho (vietnamese) was ok. In general, I think there are better deals for food in other places (we liked the buffet at Flamingo's).<br/><br/>It's possible to get a really good deal for this hotel. For us it worked our really great booking it just the day before arrival (depends on the season of course). However, be careful. There is a $20 per night resort fee due on arrival not included in any prices!	5	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

I arrived on late flight around 11:30pm, there were line up at the check in with one staff and we waited for 10 minutes. The next afternoon we head down for brunch, the whole lobby was pack of people( literally pack) and there were only 3 The staff, no kidding, you need to be patient because they work slow. She seems tired and despite the &quot;Hi, check in?&quot; she didn't want to speak more. I asked about picking up the show tickets at the hotel and all she said was &quot; oh, I don't do tickets, you need to go to the show box office.&quot; She made it sounds like she's so irritated and I am afraid to ask her where is that! ( If there's a section of staff friendliness, I would have put poor) She didn't make me feel like i am welcome at all. Anyhow, we were hungry and load our luggage and head down to the cafe for a late night snack. The waiter was very friendly, the other host was extremely helpful when I asked her where's the convenience store and pharmacy, she explained in detail of the directions. Despite the restaurant staff, I did not see any other staff working in the hotel at all for the rest of my trips! You know there's always suppose to be security walking around or TI staff around?They don't exist!! You want to know where's the washroom?Find it yourself! It's like a self serve hotel you just ask other people or look up and follow the sign. I do not like it at all. I spend all of my time walking to other hotels across and nearby, they have staff walking around helping you, they have security when i need direction, and their casino have nobody to blow their smoke in your face when you walk by! And if you have allergy, stay outside or choose other hotel because i was constantly blowing my nose due to the smoking in the hotel! We got a decent middle floor room with no strip view, it was tidy and the cleaning lady gave us extra towels when we left tips on the table. The buffer restaurant in the hotel was not as great as i expected. We had the brunch lunch buffer on the saturday and it's $35 per person, the food was pretty greasy, there were not much choices of hot dishes, i just think with that amount of price we could of eat something better elsewhere. There's a nice shopping mall one block down the road and the food court there have much more better option. Overall, the hotel experience was okay, I understand I went on a thanksgiving weekend and that's why. If i plan to go back Vegas again, I may not stay with this hotel again.	3	2	-1	3	3	2	-1	3

Upon arrival our rooms were upgraded to the corner rooms with the double view. The only problem was it took them a little over an hour to get the rooms cleaned and ready. The room itself was pleasant, looked modern, had plenty of space in the room as well as the bathroom. Overall we were pleased with the room itself. We didn't get to use the pool, spa or fitness center. I did go see the fitness center and it was pretty well equiped with dumbells up to I believe 60 lbs, various weight and cardio machines. We ate at the buffet for breakfast both days which we were pretty pleased with especially since the 2nd morning we received comp'd buffet tickets. The food was good, nothing spectacular, basic breakfast items. As for the casino itself we didn't have a problem finding tables to play on. The rooms were inexpensive, I believe it was $150 for both nights. The best part about the hotel was its location, it is walking distance to most of the larger casinos which was great especially since the weather was nice.	4	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

They were staying at the Mirage which was considerably more expensive so we decided to stay next door &amp; hoped the walk between the two wasn't bad. It ended up that there was a Tram between the two which enabled us to travel from our room (24th floor) at TI to their suite (top floor) at the Mirage in under 10 minutes without going outside. I've seen better Sports Books but it gets the job done if your into that. The country bar has some good specials &amp; a mechanical bull which is always fun. Not many roulette tables so I tended to take the tram to Mirage if I was playing table game. Great view of the strip, ask for a corner room which gives you two windows and ability to see down both ways of the strip. The pirate ships were under construction so we missed out on that and you do have to pat $20 resort fee's so be sure to clarify the attractions will be open.	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	-1

We like to go to walk around and just see the out of the world experience hotels! If you haven't been- it's worth the trip at least once. Bright lights, noise, people watching (things you'd never wear at home, you'd wear or see people wearing in Las Vegas). Not for kids. Airport is about 15 mins away. TI check in took a really really long time (60 mins- no staff).<br/>Treasure Island is a treasure in terms of beautiful rooms and we faced the pirate show (front) and it was great. You could hear and watch, but we were hardly in the hotel room. It's convenient because there is a walkway to the shopping centre. Great shopping within steps. The food was average casino food and the &quot;deli&quot; was reasonable for later night snacks. It wasn't 24h which was disappointing...because nobody sleeps in Las Vegas. The only shortfall of TI is that it's a bit far on one side of the strip- so TI is also an &quot;island&quot;. More central is Bally's/Flamingo.<br/>We like to walk, so it wasn't a big issue. We rented a car to go to the Grand Canyon (we never did it before this visit). It was about 5 hours away (North Rim). It was beautiful. You buy a pass and then there are trails and rangers. Just remember, cell phones don't work, so bring a walkie talkie if you get separated from your fellow travellers. The bus system inside is convenient. The map looks like it's close from end to end of the trails, but it's really really really far (could take a full day). Some trails are quite basic and rough, so if you're not for an adventure stick to the rim trail. Going down into the canyon (be prepared, go in a group, bring supplies) unless you are very experienced. It's dangerous. The sunset and sunrise are amazing---the guidebook will give you the best spots for pictures. It's really awe inspiring and if you like photography- you'll appreciate, no picture is a bad picture. Bring your big memory cards and lots of different types of lenses if you are a photography lover. You won't regret the drive. We stayed one night and didn't make any reservations ahead of time. The Holiday Inn Select was sold out and we stayed at the Red Feather. It was an OK motel like place. Have a good trip!	5	3	-1	5	5	3	-1	4

The room we had was fantastic and looked down the strip towards the Stratosphere. It was clean, modern and comfortable. We had a mini fridge which was a great pluse. Would stay here again. From our room we had a great view of the show but were high enough that the noise was not a big deal. I can see this being a problem with some rooms but who in Vegas to goes to bed early. The show is corny and really a waste of time in my opinion but its free. We ate at the buffet once and it was much like all other buffets. It all depends on what you like and how hungry you are. What I had was hot, tasty and there was lots. The cheap buffets are long gone and expect to pay $16.00 and up per person at the cheap times. The casino is fine but is not as opulent as some others. These should look at getting a fast food chain on the premises so a quick and cheap snack is available like other casinos have. That being said it isn't far to walk to one if thats what you want. I think the best thing about this hotel is the location. You are very near the center of the strip and access to the highway is easy.	4	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	5

It is well located and thus is the perfect place to call &quot;home base&quot; when in Vegas. It is near to Venetian, Palazzo, Mirage and Wynn and not too far a walk to Caesar's and the like.<br/>We only saw one show this visit, Bodies at the Luxor, and otherwise, just enjoyed being able to do things at our own pace, sans kiddies.<br/>My husband and I spent a fair bit of time at the tables and found the dealers were friendly, as were the others we played with. We didn't experience any folks who didn't &quot;play well with others&quot; at the blackjack tables, which made for a fabulous time.<br/>The basic rooms are practical and bathrooms are tidy, but not overly done like some of the other higher end places (really, how much time do you spend in a hotel bathroom anyway?). It has been a few years since we'd traveled to Vegas, but we were a bit surprised by the &quot;resort fee&quot; at check in. My hunch is all the hotels are doing this, but there is a per room fee that allows you access to internet, gym and other amenities. Realistically, it actually ended up being cheaper for us than in the past, as my husband and I would typically buy a pass to the work out facilities anyway. The internet connection was reliable and allowed us to check emails while away from home. Obviously, since we are on vacation, didn't spend a lot of time hanging out in room, surfing the net.<br/>If you're in the shopping mood, I suggest the Premium Outlet Mall where there are lots of good deals on name brands, kids clothes and just about anything else you can imagine. We tend to skip the strip shopping as it is generally overpriced and more glam than our personal styles ascribe to.<br/>All in all, I think you'll be happy if you book at this hotel if you are looking for a more casual atmosphere...it is money well spent.	5	5	-1	4	5	5	-1	4

We stayed in room 18022, the room was clean, it had a safe, small refrigerator, iron ( I had to ask the housekeeper for it), hair dryer and a flat screen tv ( which stopped showing the channel numbers on our last day there). The view was OK, we could see the Venetian and the volcano at the Mirage but most of the view was of the entrance and the parking lot. I mean we could still see the strip but maybe only 30% of it from our window. The window was very dirty though, they have to wash those windows. <br/><br/>The sirens of TI show was cancelled until Dec. 25, 11 so we did not have the chance to see it. The resort fee is $22.40 per day, you pick up the newspaper at the guest services, wi-fi was good. It is located right there in the middle of the strip and connected by a bridge to the Fashion Mall.<br/><br/>Overall, we got what was promised.	3	5	-1	3	4	4	-1	3

I&#39;d stay there again	4	0	This was my first time staying here (and I can be a bit hard to please), and I was a little concerned about it. Turns out TI is not a bad place to stay. It's clean, affordable and in a great location on the Strip. The staff was friendly and professional as well. <br/><br/>The food here is good, as well as the entertainment. The restaurants are surprisingly affordable. I ate at Isla and drank up at Kahunaville; both served quality beverages and the food at Isla is pretty good (can't beat their happy hour!). The buffet was not large and bountiful, like at some other properties that are famous for buffets, but the food there was hot and made with care. The one thing that can be improved on at TI are the lines... everywhere. The lines do move, but the idea that you have to queue up in a long line at check-in when you're tired, to waiting on line to eat in the buffet... you expect a line, but not as long as they are at TI. <br/><br/>If you are looking for the glitz and glamour of the newer &quot;showplace&quot; properties, then this isn't the place for you. It isn't in bad taste, beat-up or ugly, but it's not flashy or luxurious. But, if you want a clean place in a great location, reasonably priced, to gamble a little and get a few drinks at before going out, TI does the job very well. <br/><br/>(I rated the sleep quality as &quot;poor,&quot; because my bed had wear marks in it; you could feel what areas in the bed were slept in most. It wrecked my body!)	4	5	-1	4	5	3	-1	2

When we went back in February, we stayed at the Mirage. I really wanted to stay there again, but my boyfriend was dead set on TI. It was far from a bad experience, but it is no Mirage. The staff was friendly, the rooms were clean, and the location was good. I only have one complaint. We live on the east coast, so the time change is hard for the first couple days. We usually end up in bed by 9pm or so. They have a pirate show out front with fireworks, so every hour the fireworks go off and it woke us up several nights. But that's everywhere in Vegas!	3	4	-1	3	5	5	-1	4

The package included two buffets, however, we had to go to Laughlin, Nevada (small type) on an eleven hour bus trip to qualify for one of the two buffets. We did not travel to Las Vegas to visit Laughlin. This was our second trip to Treasure Island having brought our children there many years before. Our memories included the wonderful pirate ship production of fighting pirates that took place in the lagoon in front of the hotel. Todays version is nothing like the time we brought our children. The new version is skimpy clad female pirates making both physical and verbally suggestive remarks and gestures to the attackers as they approach. The old version was much more entertaining to us and more family oriented. Perhaps, we are just getting too old. On another note we thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Mystere&quot; that plays at Treasure Island most nights. It was excellent. The restaurant food was good but very expensive. In fact, everything but the room rate was expensive. The same goes for the beverages at the bar or pool. The pool area is geared for the younger set. We tried to relax by the pool and read on two different days but the recorded music that plays constantly is loud and overwhelming. After spending several days touring the area we learned that hotels such as Caesar's, Wynn Resorts and the Bellagio offer more luxury and geared for relaxation. Treasure Island is designed for young adults or those with children. If your budget is limited seriously consider a very short stay. Las Vegas is not user friendly.	3	3	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

I stayed in a Petite Suite and it served its purpose. A quick background on me, I am a definite value seeker. I prefer a property that is rated AAA 4 diamond or higher, a suite, and large jetted tub, but I also want all of this for less than $200 a night. I lived in Vegas for 11 years and when I come home to visit, I prefer a suite because I enjoy having friends come and visit, and do some entertaining before I go out. I happily paid the $20 resort fee. Why happily? I always bring my lap top and expect to pay $14.99 per 24 hours (seems to be the standard in Vegas properties without a resort fee), and because cell service can be hit or miss in Vegas hotel rooms, it is nice to be able to pick up the phone, dial, and not be charged $1/call. Like I said, I used to live there and when I am in town, I get in touch with my friends, so for me, calls can add up. I can't speak much on the food because the only restaurant I ate at is now closed, Khotan, and I can honestly say, if it weren't for the Groupon I scored ($25 for $50 f&amp;b, and I had a $10 credit, so I only paid $15) I would not go back. TI is an interesting little property. MGM Resorts did a lot last decade to de-theme many of their properties. Luxor, MGM Grand, and even Excalibur have come a long way from where they once were. They had done this with TI as well... But Phil Ruffin seems to have messed this up. Even as the properties strayed away from their theme(s), they still have a flow to them, an identity if you will. TI has become VERY confused. Gilley's country bar and Kahunaville all under the same roof? Meanwhile there is a pirate themed show outside... I want to note I have read other reviews and agree with the consensus that service has declined, cocktail service is horrible, and the casino is very dated. The fact that this place opened in 1993 has NOTHING to do with being dated, because walk in to the Mirage or MGM, and they don't feel dated. Maybe it is more of a feeling that it just isn't being taken care of. <br/><br/>The great thing about TI is the location and the value, and that is why I have booked here again for three nights in January. I signed up for their e-mail promotions and immediately received an offer for 50% off, and booked a Tower Suite for an average of $112/night (one of those nights includes a Friday). I compared the rate to other properties I put in the same league, and the rate beat Luxor's spa suite and Monte Carlo's spa suite rates, and for a suite that is about 200 square feet larger. And granted, I am not thrilled about the rest of the property, the rooms are nice (I admit, I agree, they are dark), they are clean, and I like the location.	5	5	-1	4	5	2	-1	5

It was my tenth anniversary. I read their entire website, and placed three calls (talked to the same guy every time, Brian). I did all of this because of a recent nightmare making reservations online with another hotel that apparently never existed, so I was being uber cautious with this one.<br/><br/>I called to ask about the difference between the Petite Suite and Tower Suite, and learned it's only the size of the room, so I settled on the Petite. I asked what the chances were of getting a Strip View that week, because it was romantic. He said &quot;All the rooms are strip view,&quot; I found this interesting because I'd read here that people had had mountain view rooms, but I left it alone. I booked my room, requesting the strip view and a smoking room.<br/><br/>When I arrived, the woman at the desk gave me a mountain view, no smoking room. When I asked about my strip view, she said they didn't have any. I was a bit upset, because I'd requested one and been told by Brian that Monday was slow, so I didn't figure I'd lose that room. I asked to be moved, she said all I could do was call often and ask if they had one. I'm supposed to call what, every 10 minutes? If I don't call often enough they're going to come and go anyway, right? I had no choice but to take what she had.<br/><br/>The &quot;mountain view&quot; room I was in, was a gorgeous view of....the Trump tower. Bleh. There were mountains to the left and right of it, but seriously staring at the Trump. <br/><br/>My husband got the laptop set up and was trying to log into the wi-fi that was supposed to be included in my resort fee. The page directed him to put in my credit card information, which stopped him. He called the front desk to make sure this was right and we wouldn't be charged, and they told him to put his information in and he wouldn't. Guess what? Three $14.99 charges from Cox are on my credit card. When this was mentioned at the front desk, the woman tending the customers next to us jumped in the conversation and acted as if we were stupid. We should have never put in information, it should have only been last name/room number, etc. The man actually checking us out gave us a $22 credit, but said we'd have to call Cox because it was their fault, not TI's.<br/><br/>The second day I was there I went to the front desk about the room again. We dealt with a very, very nice woman who worked hard to find us a room. She found a strip view room, but non smoking. I took it anyway. I had wanted the strip view more than I cared about smoking. The interesting this is, I originally booked a smoking strip, but there are signs in the lobby my husband saw that said the hotel rooms were all nonsmoking. Yet...the front desk was continuously trying to find me a smoking suite...?<br/><br/>I was also informed on check-in that the Sirens were not showing and would not be until Dec. 26. Would have been nice to have read that on their website, as it was part of the reason I booked there. So that was part of that &quot;resort fee&quot; that never got used aside from internet.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed with the process as a whole. The rooms are very nice however, and were very comfortable to stay in. The beds and bedding were like clouds. Room service is ridiculously over priced, but it is anywhere you go. The hotel was clean and fairly quiet. The rates were pretty good for the nights we stayed. The cleaning staff was very friendly, and one of our front desk people were great. The others could have acted like they cared more.<br/><br/>If you are planning for an ultra-special occasion like we were, just be sure to call and make iron-clad reservations. That's what I did and it still didn't work, but it's worth a try. In the end I got the room I wanted (minus the smoking), it was just a pain.	4	4	-1	4	4	3	-1	5

The hotel is on the strip and in a pretty good spot. We just had a standard room but with a strip view and it was awesome - huge room, comfy bed, massive bathroom - loved it! We actually had a view of the strip and the mountains. The room was clean and well kept - didn't have any issues with safety. We ate at Isla (yum!) pricey, but it was nice. Kahunaville was fun esp with the flair bartenders and free shots and breakfast there is pretty reasonable also. There is a Walgreens across the road too, which was good for us to get cheap salad sandwiches if we didn't want a heavy dinner or lunch. The only thing I didn't think was great was the buffet, but we got vouchers on arrival so i'm not too phased. The vegies were good and so was the sweet bar - everything else though was not that appealing or tasty. Rates were cheap THEN you add the resort fee - still pretty cheap though. I will be returning to Vegas and will be staying at TI.	4	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

There's a lot to like about TI. <br/>1) The rooms - rooms are comfortable. Nothing fancy, but absolutely adequate and in great shape. Best part is the bed - one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in.<br/>2) The price - its not Stratosphere, Excalibur, Luxor or (shudder) Circus Circus, but its not expensive either. You can get a room here mid week for about $70 per night, or $120 or so on a peak season weekend, which is fine. <br/>3) The Location - its right opposite the Venetian/Palazzo and next to the Mirage, which is pretty damn central. Its also adjacent to the Fashion Square Mall (or whatever its called).<br/>4) The Poker Room - a separate room and nice, easy action. Not too many local sharks, plenty of tourist fish.<br/>5) The Atmosphere - Its got a nice cosy feel to it. Its not out of control huge like some of the other places.<br/><br/>I would almost certainly stay at TI again.	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	5

The location is also great, if you want to be near the Venetian and all the other good things on that end of the strip.<br/><br/>A word to the price-conscious traveler: The room-service food IS delicious, but they add a $5 charge to your room tab for each time you order a meal brought up to your room (just something to keep in mind). Also, my sister and I went together for a three-day weekend, ordered the room ahead with money down, and when we checked-out, based on the resort fees and things they tacked on, the room was $200 more than the original price we were quoted online.	3	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	4

The hotel has changed hands since my last stay but I couldn't see a huge difference and I found all of the staff to be very polite and helpful.<br/><br/>Upon check-in there was no queue and we were allocated our room promptly and given lots of information about the hotel and we were also advised that if the room was not suitable then to come back down and they would do their best to find us an alternative.<br/><br/>Our room was on the 19th floor with a great view of the strip. The room appeared to have been recently refurbished and the beds were as always very comfortable which is another major plus to staying at Treasure Island. The room was cleaned on a daily basis with the towels being changed and any of the room staff that we encountered were also very polite and friendly. <br/><br/>There is as many people have complained about in previous reviews the resort fee, which ok it is not great that you have to pay this additional charge, I do wish that they would just include it in the room cost but still it did include unlimited internet, use of the phone etc but we were in Vegas to have a great time not sit and surf the net!<br/><br/>There are a few options for eating within the hotel, but we were drawn to the buffet which was very good and many of the staff have been working there since my first visit back in 2005. They had a wide selection to choose from and the staff were very helpful in assisting as well as providing drinks refills. The only drawback to the buffet is that there was often a long queue to get in, especially during peak times.<br/><br/>There is a Starbucks within the hotel, together with one at the entrance and then you also have the choice of more places within the Fashion Show Mall which is linked with the hotel.<br/><br/>Location is excellent, with as mentioned direct access to the Fashion Show Mall, together with access to the Mirage via the Tram and The Wynn and Venetian are just across the road. We had a car as we were also visiting other areas of Nevada and Arizona and parking was excellent with the lot being directly attached providing safe, secure parking.<br/><br/>Overall I would highly recommend Treasure Island, it offers great value for money and the savings you make on staying here can be spent elsewhere. <br/><br/>Look forward to staying again.	5	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	5

Quiet room, beds were comfy. Only complaint was that our room was not cleaned on the one day, when mentioned to staff she stated she would speak to her supervisor and it was cleaned promptly from then on. We found this casino to be less smoky than casinos at other hotels and it smelled cleaner. Overall a very good first time Vegas experience.

We received a great promo deal for our room. The wait was quite long while checking in. At 3:30pm, you'd think they would have the front desk full of employees to check guests in. They only had about 4-5 and it took a long time. The service was very friendly during check in and check out.<br/><br/>We like this place because of the great location. It's right across from Palazzo, Wynn, and Venetian. Plus, it's nice to be right next to the Fashion Show Mall. <br/><br/>We enjoy the rooms because they are updated with modern decor, the beds are very comfy, to include the pillows, and the are decent sized rooms. We had a mini fridge in the room (it's in the closet) and the bathroom is spacious. There's a flatscreen TV in every room.<br/><br/>I did notice this time the cigarette smoke was worse than last time we were here. When you walk into the property, you can smell a fragrance throughout the vent system, but once you walk further into the casino, the smoke becomes very strong. This is one drawback to this casino because I've noticed at other casinos, the air is fresher.<br/><br/>During this stay, we ate at the Coffee Shop for breakfast and at Gilly's for dinner. The Coffee Shop was good and had nice service, but a bit expensive for breakfast. Gilly's was really good and had large portions. The service at Gilly's was excellent and the prices were reasonable for BBQ.<br/><br/>My husband would definately return to Treasure Island because of the reasonable prices we can find and the rooms.	5	5	-1	5	4	4	-1	4

I would say the best thing about TI is the location. We ate at the buffet which was average. Will definitely return in the near future<br/><br/>Hotel has tram that connects to the mirage, 2nd floor near mystere theater.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	4

Check in was easy and the front desk staff was very friendly, but the &quot;good service&quot; ended there. The dealers had no personality. After check in we were told we had to change rooms, and when we went to the front desk to switch rooms everyone was very rude. The casino was very dated and seemed very stuffy. The location was not bad, but if you want to have a good time you must go to Aria, Cosmopolitan, or Planet Hollywood. It is about a 25 minute walk or a $10 cab ride. The room was sufficient very similar to a room at Hilton Garden Inn. The restaurants were very plain and the food was nothing special. Upon check out we were told we owed $400 even though we had already paid. It took over an hour before a manager was called to rectify the issue, without an apology. I would look elsewhere for a place to stay in Vegas.	3	3	-1	3	3	2	-1	-1

Friendly and very accomodating receptionist, we were upgraded to a strip view interconnecting rooms without asking. Fantastic location on the strip and the 'nicer' end of the strip. Hotel had walk way to Fashion Plaza which was great as the girls could wander over anytime. Also close to Forum Shops which were open late so girls were in heaven! We all felt safe wandering around this end of the strip at night. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. <br/>Only negative was casino was so smoky and a perfume smell was pumped thru to disguise the smoke which made it worse. Unfortunately you had to walk through casino to get to the lifts to get to your room! <br/>Also made a outerstate phone call for about 3 minutes and was charged $27.00. I queried this and was told it was $13.00 for the outerstate line then so much per minute. Thought this was a riduculous price and thank goodness I didn't talk longer!<br/>All in all it was still a pleasant place to stay	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Our last trip here was in October for my Husband's 40th, check in was a breeze, very friendly and we were given a free room upgrade. The room was a view of the strip and on a corner so great views, lovely comfortable bed. We love the location of TI, right next to the Fashion show Mall and just over the road to the Venetian (where we love to have breakfast at the Grand Luxe Cafe). The food served at Treasure Island is decent and fairly priced - it's not the Bellagio which is our favourite hotel but then its not Bellagio prices either and it's a lovely walk down the strip to the Bellagio and Cosmopolitan.	5	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

Check in process was quick and easy on the Sunday night when I arrived around 6pm. I had booked my airfare and hotel via Southwest Vacations and received a decent rate. I found out before I arrived that TI charges an additional $20 per night plus tax for a resort fee. I didn't complain but this fee is a joke. It covers access to the pool/spa, printing of boarding passes, and wifi access among other items. The only thing I used during my 4 night stay was the printer access for the boarding passes. So essentially I was charged $88 to print 2 pages of paper. <br/><br/>The room was on the 17th floor and was nice size for a single traveler. The king bed was comfortable. One thing I found in my room though was that there were not many power outlets. I tried to plug my cell charger into the alarm clock port marked for it but it would not charge my phone. The only power outlet near the bed was below the headboard and had to plug in there. I also could not figure out how to set the alarm or time on the clock and it was about 35 minutes off. <br/><br/>We utilized the buy one get one for the lunch buffet one day. I thought the food was good. We timed it just right (not planned) and were able to get a made to order omelet before they switched over to lunch, and then had a made to order pasta dish. The buffet cost us around $18 with the coupon. <br/><br/>The casino was not as busy as others on the strip and I did not have problems getting to the roulette table anytime I wanted. <br/><br/>One night I visited the country bar and enjoyed watching people attempt to ride the mechanical bull, but the place wasn't busy and overall wasn't much fun. <br/><br/>I would definitely stay here again at the right price or if they get rid of the resort fee.	3	5	-1	4	5	4	-1	4
UR121893546	991DED683978CCE995EC5568AD5171FA	Treasure Island - TI Hotel & Casino	Las_Vegas_Nevada	2011-12-19	Not too much of a treasure in Vegas	3	0	My husband and I took a little Vegas get away in November.We took some time in finding a room since we were going to spend 4 nights there and because we wanted to be on the strip, wanted a view and didn't want a tiny room but also didn't want to have to get a loan to afford the room. Rates are high in Vegas!! In the past we have stayed at the Riviera, the Rio and the Luxor. <br/>We ended up choosing the Treasure Island hotel because of reasonable rates for a large room and the location. We booked a Tower suite. Upon making reservations my husband requested a view room of the strip and pirates cove and was promised that he would get a great view. We arrived, checked in with ease, went to our room on the 8th floor and were really disappointed. Our view was of the top of the roof and the vents and the top of the trees and the back of the coves buildings.We pick up our luggage, trudged back to the desk (holding our breath while we traveled through the SMOKEY casino) and got back in line at the desk and asked for a different room. This time they sent us up to the 21st floor. MUCH better. <br/><br/>The tower suites look great on-line and were probably pretty snazzy in 1980 -1990. But now even though it was spacious, the room decor and furnishings were VERY dated. The carpets were very much in need of replacement and I didn't want to go barefoot. There was a big lump under the carpet in the middle of the room that we kept tripping on, don't know what that was all about. The couches needed to be recovered or steam cleaned or freshened up somehow. They just seemed tacky. <br/>The bathrooms were nice, one had a shower, one had a jacuzzi. We didn't use the jacuzzi but the shower was large and nice. There were 2 phones in the room but not a trace of a phone book anywhere which we needed on several occasions. There were hair dryers and an ironing board, iron and an in-room safe. There was a small refrigerator that didn't work very well. There was no coffee pot and no microwave. I would have much rather had those two things than an extra bathroom. There was a nice flatscreen television. A nice little table and chairs where we would sit and plan our day and PRETEND we were drinking our morning coffee in our pajamas (without having to wait for room service or get dressed and trudge down to Starbucks :) <br/>The bed was one of the worst beds we ever slept in in all of our travels, in fact my husband spent the first night trying to sleep on the couch. The bed was lumpy and soft and we rolled to the middle. I felt like I was sleeping in a laundry basket full of unfolded clothes. <br/>There was wifi in room but if you didn't have a laptop using the hotel internet service was a whopping $1 a minute so be prepared for that.<br/><br/>As I stated before the casino area was very smokey but most of them are. They have the nightly show at the Pirates cove. Now called the Siren's Cove I used to think it was a fun show but they changed the program to a bunch of girating sirens trying to capture the pirates and singing corny songs. We got through it once and never went back, most of the spectators around us shared our opinion. Sorry TI try again. They also shoot off cannon reports and fireworks at each showing so if you have rooms on that side of the hotel, bring your earplugs. <br/><br/>The restaurants were Ok. We did the buffet and Gilley's ( food was good there) and Starbucks because the hotel didn't offer in room coffee ( grrr) but ate on the strip or out of town the rest of the time. The hotel is located near the Palazzo, Venetian, Mirage, Wynn and Encore and right next to the shopping mall so the location was good for us. Parking was included in our room rate so that was good also.<br/>We rented a car and went down town to the Freemont experience. That's always fun and nice to get away from the strip. The restaurant we wanted to go to there was closed on a Tuesday night and we found out a few others were also closed on that night too but we ended up at Tinoco's Italian restaurant while there and had a fabulous dining experience! Thumbs up for that one!<br/>We also went to the Mead Lake Recreation Area (beautiful) and the Hoover Dam. We loved the little shops and the town of Boulder City <br/><br/>All in all The Treasure Island Hotel wasn't a horrible hotel or hotel experience but I think we'd choose somewhere different and newer or at the least, more updated next time. I doubt we'll go back to Vegas for sometime anyway since there too many other places we haven't been to. We thought many people we extremely rude and inconsiderate to others in Vegas. (Probably tourists not the locals) They couldn't even wait for you to get out of an elevator before they were pushing you aside trying to get in. This kind of stuff happened over and over. We saw a bunch of 20 somethings do it to an elderly handicapped man that was struggling to get out of the elevator and thought it was unforgivable behaviour.<br/><br/>One huge complaint we had about our Vegas experience is the use of Mexican (illegals maybe?) to push x rated material in everyones faces about every ten feet or so all along the strip. (even the folks that were with children) It became VERY annoying and was a real turn off while trying to enjoy the strip and frankly kind of spoiled the whole thing. The City of Vegas needs to address this situation, it's getting out of hand. So be prepared for that if you visit. <br/><br/>Good luck and have fun on your Vegas trip!	3	5	-1	2	3	2	-1	1

The hotel is older but the rooms were large and clean. Overall the housekeeping staff were quite friendly and efficient, except for one lady. I had wanted an extra laundry bag and found the nearest housekeeping lady on the floor. She seemed to take offence that I was asking her for one and when she didn't have one in her cart, she stormed off to ask the next lady for one, complaining in Spanish loudly the entire time even though I was right behind her the whole time. When she got the laundry from her coworker, she gave it to me with a glare and then resumed complaining in Spanish when I turned to go back to my room. My ethnicity is Asian and I don't understand Spanish but I'm North American born and fluent in English. If she didn't want to get me a laundry bag, I would have much preferred a simple &quot;no&quot; or even a &quot;go away&quot; instead of the treatment that I received. The only reason I would stay at this hotel again is for the value, and I would prefer to pay slightly more and stay at a better hotel.	4	4	-1	3	4	3	-1	3

TI is right in the middle of everything. It sits next to The Mirage (connected via tram) and the Fashion Show Mall (via pedestrian bridge). Wynn and Venetian resorts are across the street.<br/><br/>My thoughts on Treasure Island, or TI as they call it nowadays are mostly positive. There are a few caveats.<br/><br/>Check in was quick, mostly due to visiting during the week before Christmas. Not wanting to hear street noise, I asked for a room on a high floor. Request granted, I was put on the 36th floor which is accessible only by inserting the room card in the elevator. <br/><br/>The room was average sized and spotless. I'm not sure if this applies to other floors, but the ceiling must have been 11-12 ft high. The decor is dark earth tone browns which was just fine. The TV set is either a 27 or 32 inch and gets some local &amp; sports channels but no HBO. I find that surprising given that this is a 4-star property. Also missing was a refrigerator, nor was there a minibar. Special top-floor room accessible only by key card and it doesn't include a refrigerator? Down the hall there is an ice machine and some vending machines. Another negative is that the mattress needs to be turned, or to have its pillow top replaced. There is a definite depression from where countless people have slept. Also, shower pressure is a small trickle. I don't know how this relates to nearby properties, but I do realize that Las Vegas is in the middle of the desert. Back to the positives, the bedding was comfortable and the Oleksandra (house spa) brand toiletries were nice. <br/><br/>The $20 mandatory resort fee includes internet (wifi). I found the connection to be inconsistent. Downloading normal webpages was okay but uploading even a small email attachment took a very long time. <br/><br/>The casino is dark and smelly, and one must navigate through it to reach the hotel elevators. Joining TI's rewards club gave me $5 in free play. You then spin an electronic wheel a la Price is Right style to see how much they will add to it. I, and everyone else got $5, bringing the total to $10. Larger amounts are possible but I didn't see anyone get more. I used $1 of my own to start a slot machine and promptly lost the $10 plus my $1. <br/><br/>Mystere by Cirque du Soleil is one of the best shows I've ever seen. This is my third time seeing it and I'm still very impressed. I recommend it highly, and advise anyone to book tickets in advance. <br/><br/>The buffet was quite good, especially breakfast for $16. I was up early and didn't have to wait in line. There plenty of choices, all of which are fresh. There was a long line for dinner so I opted for the steakhouse instead (next).<br/><br/>My package with TI included a $50 resort credit which I used to take my girlfriend to Phil's Italian Steakhouse. The petit filet (6 oz) is excellent and the service was seamless. <br/>I wasn't sure if I should give TI 3 or 4 stars. <br/><br/>Until now I wasn't sure how many stars I would rate Ti. The staff were great. The location is great. So are the entertainment and dining options. However I do feel that they need some upgrades (to the mattresses for starters). Every room should have a small refrigerator, too. And if they are going to play the resort fee game, Internet connectivity needs to improve. I recommend TI for someone who gets a special deal. At regular rates other hotels nearby might be better for the money. Three stars it is.	3	5	-1	3	4	4	-1	2

The room was beautiful, the tub to die for and it was very clean. The pluses were many, we were allowed to check in at 11am, the check in lady was awesome, we asked if there was a chance we could get a room with a view and she gave us a room with a gorgeous view of the strip we could see both the Mirage volcano and some of the Bellagio fountain. The only minus was a situation with the internet. It went out the second day and we got a nasty response from a front desk woman when we called but the next evening we got another staff person who was very nice and fixed it by resetting it. Definitely check their website for deals I got the Petite Suite for $70 a night in the middle of the week, the cirque du soleil Mystere it an absolute must and the Petite Suite worth it.	5	4	-1	5	5	4	-1	4

Bad was the slots just play to play don,t play to win. we had a vip pass to the Pirate show we looked forward to seeing it for a long time mostly the reason we stayed at TI guess what no Pirate show cancelled for one month while we were there I learned that upon check in also I was under the impression we got three free buffets all we got was one two for one buffet it was my wifes birthday reason we went there when we did it was not recognized we were just another bunch of quests.<br/>also bad was the weather except for sunny skies it was cold in the mornings no swimming.<br/>Ugly we saw a lot of pan handlers asking for money on the bridges and around near the hotels and once you got off the strip a bit garbage and undesirable people didn't,t make us feel comfortable. All in all Vegas didn't, disappoint Us but we felt at the end we would have been better off to go to Mexico for a one week all inclusive for the same amount we spent.<br/>seemed a Little bit to me like instead of making us feel like we were something more like we had to pay the price just because it was Las Vegas.	3	5	-1	4	3	4	-1	2

We decided to stay an extra night at the beginning of the stay and were really looking for price over quality. We decided that TI would be a good balance between the 2. Well we were wrong, and it a good way! <br/><br/>We arrived about a half hour before check-in time, and were greeted with a smile, and given a room right away. Our room had a partial strip view, with views of the Venetian, Palazzo, and if you looked at an angle you could see the Wynn. The room was more spacious then we thought it would be, it was very clean and in great repair. The room had a flat panel LCD TV (and although it wasnt working when we checked in, it was fixed right away) and a good sized desk. It had a nice seating area, and a standard bathroom, but with a good sized bathtub.<br/><br/>I only have a few minor complaints, but they did not effect the overall experience that we had. You have to pay a 22 dollar resort fee. The resort fee includes wireless internet in the room. The way it is set up though is somewhat inconvenient. When you are logging in you have to accept a charge of 11.99 for 24 hours. I called the front desk and they assured me I would not be charged (and I wasn't) but I still feel like that should be changed. My other complaint was that the Siren show was not up and running when I visited. Not a huge deal, but one of the things included in the resort fee is VIP viewing for the show, so I was kind of bummed about that.<br/><br/>And another small thing, and this is at no fault of the hotel, but something to be aware of, TI is pretty far north on the strip, so be prepared to do some walking. It is not a terrible location and not as far north as some of the hotels, but there are other hotels that are closer to the center of the strip, so if that is important to you, keep that in mind.<br/><br/>Other than that everything was great. I came early enough that there was no line for check-in. The room was clean and in good repair. The casino is very clean and nice (although it smells like smoke, but hey it's Vegas, get over it) I can definitely see us returning here.	5	3	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Between the great casino to the fantastic places to eat, we had a ball. Free show out front, with the best &quot;seats&quot; going to hotel guests, was first rate. Fireballs and beautiful actors and actresses performing several times per nite, every nite! Room Service was super. Employees were great.

It is outdated, especially in the bathroom, where it is dark and does not have a wall unit hair dryer. (it's in the closet). The furniture was kind of falling apart as well. Overall, the value of this hotel is great for it's location. It is right across from the Palazzo, next to the Fashion Mall, and just walking distance to other big name hotels. One of the pitfalls that they add on to the low cost is a $20 a day &quot;resort fee&quot;. Covers the paper, access to wifi (that doesn't mean it's included, that's another $14 for 24 hours). They give you a lot of coupons like a free buffet for during the week. Eat at the buffet!! It has amazing food with an incredibly large variety and selection. The slots and tables are good and waitresses come around every once in awhile, atleast by the slots. I do not regret staying here and would stay here again.	4	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

We still talk about how wonderful the beds in our room were. Sirens show at night is worth seeing. Better from the Siren's cove lounge to avoid the crowds of people on the walkway. The one late night eating place in the casino was great, affordable and decent food. <br/>What could use work: cleanliness of the room wasn't the best. There was hair in the bathroom including on the ceiling (?). We did complain - the front desk staff were empathetic.. but it wasn't cleaned up. No fast food places in the immediate vicinity it seemed? (McDonalds etc)<br/>Overall a pretty good stay.	3	4	-1	4	2	2	-1	5

After travelling on an early morning flight, the kids, my elderly parents and myself were extremely tired and just wanted to relax in our rooms before we would go out on the strip. Although the manager at the check-in tried his best to accomodate us, but to our surprise our rooms were not ready and we had to wait 3 hours until finally we got our rooms. Secondly the rooms needed much upgrading. There was no clock in the room, couldn't tell what time it was. No coffee machine, even inexpensive hotels supply that. The buffet was lousy. Only the dessert selection was much better than the actual main course. Would not stay here again.	1	3	-1	1	2	1	-1	2

Make the trip to either on-premise Starbucks and byoc. Mystere by Cirque du Soleil is here and the grace and athleticism of performers are second to none.

My experience was very positive: The service was excellent - check in was very fast and painless. Great location on the strip. Very comfortable bed. Room was very clean. I found the place very quiet and was able to sleep very well for the few hours I allowed myself. I was very pleased with the price. The food at the hotel was fantastic. The only negatives I had were the $20 per day resort fee (just a money grab), and that prices for food and drinks were a lot higher than expected. This was my first visit to Las Vegas and although I enjoyed this hotel, I'll probably stay somewhere else on my next visit - just to experience something different.	4	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

We just returned from our trip (Dec 24-28). The property is badly need of a revamp - they still rely on their original theme. Our rooms were the standard room, looking their age. New carpet would be an improvement because the current ones have burn holes in many places. The plumbing could also do a revamp - noisy, and takes awhile to get hot water. The worst part of the room, is the housekeeping - or should we say, lack of. We did get clean linens and soaps, but a good vacuum would have been appreciated - and we were there 4 nights. The food in the restaurants is only average - the coffee shop is way overpriced for the quality of food - $65 for sandwiches and salads for 3. The Christmas buffet was a big disappointment - advertised an upgraded menu, but the only upgraded item was the price. There was boiled shrimp and crab legs, but that was about the only upgrade we found from other days. The dessert bar is the highlight of the entire buffet. We did have great experiences with the valet staff - very capable, friendly, courteous, and speedy. Will we go back to TI? Don't think so.	4	3	-1	2	1	3	-1	5

It is connected to the Shopping mall next door.<br/>We also took a tour bus to the Fashion Outlet mall ouside the city, it took about 40 minutes to get there. The mall is not very large and not really worth the time to get there.<br/>I read a few reviews about Treasure Island concerning the Check in.<br/>BE PREPARED to wait in line at least 30-45 minutes. It takes longer then waiting in line to check into your flight at the airport. The lady who checked us in said there is alwasys a line and sometimes even worse then when we arrived. We arrived at 4pm.<br/>There is a $20.00 Resort Fee per day, with this you get free internet. Many of the other hotels on the strip advertised &quot;no resort Fees&quot;.<br/>The only negative point of vegas is the SMOKING, people are smoking everywere, all the casinos allow smoking adn to get to and from your room at Treasure Island...you have to walk by the casino.<br/>If you are going to see any show while you are there, I HIGHLY recommend seeing Cirque De Soliel 'O&quot;. I have seen almost every other Cirque show and &quot;O&quot; blew me away, amazing.<br/>We woudl still stay at Treasure Island on our next trip to Vegas.	4	4	-1	4	4	5	-1	5

But if you compare it to the other famous Vegas hotels, it's average. The interior or the architecture has nothing special. The wi-fi is not free. When I booked this hotel, it was written '2 free buffets per stay' but when i checked in, they told me the buffet coupons aren't valid in week-ends. And I was there only for the week-end.

To add insult the clerk gave us a coupon for a 2 for 1 buffet dinner but it was only good until 6pm that day. The room was adequate but nothing special. Fortunately, internet was included for both our laptops and iPads. The location on the strip was ideal. We were right next door to the Mirage and across the street from the Wynn.	3	5	-1	3	4	3	-1	3

We had a room that was half facing the strip and half facing the mountains, so two thumbs up for the view. But we did notice that the swimmng pool looked tiny from our 22nd floor room (It was winter so the pool was closed). It was good that there was a mini fridge, but too bad there were no kettles or coffee machines, even housekeeping didn't have any (they told us to call room service, wonder how much they would've charged for hot water!). Toiletries weren't fantastic but on the upside the bathtub was wonderfully deep and spacious. <br/><br/>It's a long distance from the carpark to the hotel area, though this might be the same with all hotels in vegas. The buffet wasn't fantastic, choose this only if you had no other options. Tried the Vietnamese restaurant downstairs called Pho, it was pretty good. If you're into shopping another upside is the hotel is right next door to the Fashion Mall and you can come to the foodcourt for breakfast rather than walking all the way down to McDonald's near The Flamingo hotel where it's often a full house with no available seats. There is also a Walgreen's opposite.. <br/><br/>I don't think I'd stay here again eventhough it's relatively cheap. It's a bit far from the hustle and bustle of mid strip, you almost feel isolated being so far away at the top of the strip and it's quite a distance to walk to mid strip too.	3	3	-1	4	5	3	-1	5

I booked this last minute but was able to get a great price by booking on their website and signing up for thier guestbook. When we arrived the line to check in was extremely long to check in, but what do you expect for the day before New Years Eve? Even though the line was long, it moved very quickly. The lady we got to check us in was very nice and helpful. I was so happy that the elevators were not far from the lobby and the hotel was easy to navigate. Even though I did not book a room with a view, I still received a room with a nice view no extra charge. Room was very clean. Shower had nice pressure. Only thing I did not like was at night I had a hard time falling asleep due to people slamming doors and yelling in the hall. <br/><br/>We received a 2 for 1 coupon for the buffet and a 2 for cocktail for use at one of the bars. I believe this is what is part of the Resort Fee. I'm not sure while a lot of people claim these resort fees are &quot;hidden&quot;. They are clearly stated when booking. Also its not just Las Vegas doing it now days. Earlier in the year I went to Palm Desert and almost all the hotels now charge a resort fee. Anyway the buffet was so good just as I remembered. We went for dinner and used the coupon. Still came out to $30, so $15 each person. Made to order salad and pasta stations. Great pizza, not rubbery like most buffet pizza's. Meat and seafood stations. Sushi station. GREAT dessert station. <br/><br/>There is a tram that goes from TI to the Mirage which is nice. <br/><br/>Was able to do express checkout on the tv which was so helpful. <br/><br/>Take a chance on this hotel and you wont be disappointed. I would for sure stay here again.	4	4	-1	5	5	4	-1	3

The room had a flat screen tv, very comfortable king size bed, and a lounge chair. The bathroom has one sink and a bathtub/shower. The room and the bathroom were very clean. <br/>It was a non-smoking room, but for some reason it seemed as if the people in the room next door were smoking and the smoke was going through the bathroom vents. That was the only thing I did not like. <br/>The hotel has a buffet which was very delicious and clean. I recommend the vietnamese soup Pho, it was my first time having it and I thought it was very good. The Cirque du Soleil show did not have any showings on Thursday night when we were there so we went somewhere else. <br/>This hotel had a good ticket price and has very nice, comfortable rooms I would recommend it to anyone.	4	4	-1	4	5	4	-1	4

It's a very easy hotel to pull up to...plenty of valet to help you with your bags, etc. Check-in lines can be long, but once you stay here a few times and gamble, you will get offers and you can use the invited guest line.<br/><br/>Rooms have been re-done and are nice. Nothing elaborate by any means, but none the less, they are clean and the bed is comfortable. We have never had a problem with room noise. Bathrooms are older design(one sink), shower in the tub, etc. Safe in room. I have stayed here myself alone and have always felt safe.<br/><br/>Casino has alot of good slot games. This is one casino it seems you can play at for hours...not necessarily winning anything, but at least your money seems to last...:) Good beverage service with comped drinks for playing. Table games as well, but not that many.<br/><br/>Not very many shops. A few good bars and restuarants. Breeze Bar in the lobby seems to always be packed. We stop there for our &quot;welcome&quot; drink when we arrive. The buffet price is high for what it is. The food is always good, but nothing really special. Nice buffet room with lots of wood. Desserts are tasty. <br/>Mystere is the show that is played here. I can easly recommend that to you...it was worth seeing. They have alot of show specials, so try to catch one. There is an escalator that will take to you the Fashion Square Mall(promixity) for easy walking access. <br/><br/>The pool is small with alot of concrete. The music is pretty loud. Not one of the best pools in Las Vegas for sure. But, it still gets the job done(tanning).<br/><br/>We get rooms comped here alot, but even without that, the hotel value is good for the price. We like it.	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

The room looked to be fairly newly remodeled (I'm not sure if it really was ). The one &quot;complaint&quot; that I have is the resort fee. I wish they would just include it in the price (I know many hotels in Vegas have this fee). This location was great! Walgreens across the street, Venetian and Palazzo shops nearby. We found some great restaurants close to the hotel and enjoyed Isla, inside the casino. Our room overlooked the Strip so we heard the fireworks from the pirate show nightly but it really wasn't a bother. I would definitely stay here again.	4	5	-1	5	4	4	-1	4
UR122496089	B1363DA4935796C14AA19BFFDE6BAD6A	Treasure Island - TI Hotel & Casino	Las_Vegas_Nevada	2012-01-03	Very happy with our stay in Vegas - great location!	4	0	I believe that Treasure Island (or T.I., as the locals call it), was fantastically located for our Vegas holiday. It was towards the end of the strip where the Venitian, Palazzo etc., are located, which is where some of the best shopping / restaurants were. So it's quite central to get around on foot. <br/>The room we stayed in was a suite, and for the price (compared to some of the other hotels), it was amazing. We had a his and hers bathroom, a safe, a king size bed, and a spa tub, which was all perfectly clean. Housemaids visited every day to clean our rooms. It was beautifully furnished and designed.<br/>The only downfall of our room was I didn't believe it was very soundproof. I could hear when people were outside our apartment (though we were on a quiet floor so it was by no means a problem), and perhaps we could have been heard from outside as well. Also, we could hear the traffic below, but it wasn't so bad that we had issues sleeping. <br/>TI overall does not have a very good selection of restaurants and shopping, but all of the other hotels are literally at your doorstep so it's not like you have to walk very far to get where you would like. In saying this however, one of our favourite restaurants was the Mexican restaurant in TI - you must try the Kalua Creme Br?l?e! Room service was great, however we are very healthy people, and it was a struggle to find perfectly healthy meals on the menu, especially for breakfast. And expect the staff to be blown away in shock if you ask not to have any bread! So for the health conscious - prepare to give up during your time in Vegas!<br/>Also another tip (especially for fellow Australians): take a roll of $1 bills with you for tipping. In Australia, it is not customary to tip, however it is very much so in Vegas. We were hit with a very embarrassing moment with the bell boy, who helped us with our luggage at the end of our stay (without us asking to), who would not let the taxi leave until we tipped him, and we had almost run out of money as we were on the way home. As a result, we were forced to give him a large note, for which he did not offer change. Don't expect anything for free in Vegas, not even some simple advice, even a photo with a character in the street requires a tip!<br/>Also, this may sound pessimistic, but ignore everyone in the street that tries talking to you. They are probably trying to sell you something and it is very hard to get rid of them once they start!	5	5	-1	4	5	2	-1	5

A great choice	4	6	I stayed at this hotel for my girlfriend's birthday, so I requested a king sized bed in a non-smoking room w/ strip view. Upon arrival they informed me that there were no more king beds in a non-smoking/strip view room. However, after clicking a few times in the computer, she &quot;found&quot; one (the same thing they told me at the Flamingo; so don't take &quot;no&quot; for an answer, people). The lady was very nice though, so no big deal. They charge you a $20 resort fee/night which includes 2-for-1 lunch or dinner buffet (Mon-Fri), free internet access, VIP viewing of Sirens of T.I. (which wasn't playing that weekend because of construction or remodeling), and a few other amenities. Honestly, I think it's BS that you HAVE to pay the fee, but when you think about it, it might not be so bad as most other hotels make you pay for internet, which I tend to use a lot when I'm in Vegas, by the hour or day.<br/><br/>THE ROOM: <br/>...was very nice for a not-so-upscale hotel (i.e., Wynn). The room was clean and well-kept. The color of the room was a little dark, but went well with the pirate theme of the resort and there was no shortage of lights/lamps in the room. The king sized bed was VERY comfortable; it feels like you melt away as soon as you lay on it. The bathroom was pretty neat also- one of the better looking bathrooms in a non-suite or non-upgraded room. The shower was a good sized shower/bathtub combo, so ladies, or gents, can bathe and relax after a taxing walk on the strip. The room came with a flat screen tv (I think 27&quot; or 32&quot;) and ipod dock. <br/><br/>STRIP VIEW: <br/>...I feel that it was worth paying the extra $10/night for strip view, as I got an amazing view of the entire strip. I was actually able to see the Bellagio fountains (in the distance), Mirage's volcano show, Venetian's Christmas light show, TI pool, and the mountains all at the same time. However, some people have written that they got a nice strip view without paying the extra $10, so you may want to take that chance if you please. <br/><br/>THE CASINO:<br/>...was a little dark, which I feel accentuated the resort's pirate theme. I didn't explore the resort much, but I do know there were a few bars, a few restaurants, and, of course, Mystere by Cirque du Soleil (great show). The casino floor isn't very big, so it can get VERY crowded, but luckily we went during a slow week and crowds were no issue. The pool seemed a bit small and plain. The outside of the hotel is perhaps its most appealing asset, as the hotel welcomes you from the outside with a big pirate (or viking-looking) ship and a skull-faced rock in the TI lagoon. The service was okay- most of the employees were nice, but there were a few employees that seemed like they hated their jobs and were not sociable at all. The location of the hotel may make it less appealing to some, as it is one of the northern-most hotels on the strip (Stratosphere, Wynn/Encore, Circus Circus, Riviera, and the Fashion Show Mall are the only places that come to mind that go past the TI).<br/><br/>COMPARED TO OTHER HOTELS:<br/>...I have read other's posts stating the hotel is terrible, outdated, and a waste of money because it does not compare to the Wynn, Venetian, Bellagio, etc. Granted that it is not at any of those hotels' levels, but no one claims it is. I see this hotel as a higher-than-middle-tier hotel, on the same level as Paris, Planet Hollywood, and Mirage. It is one step above the Monte Carlo &amp; NYNY and one step below MGM &amp; Caesar's. The hotel won't charge you an exorbitant price to stay in an awesome suite, but you won't feel like your sleeping in thousands of other people's filth, either- you get your money's worth. <br/><br/>ALL IN ALL:<br/>...The hotel is a nice hotel. If you're looking to get a reasonable rate for an above-average hotel, I would definitely recommend this hotel. The hotel honestly gives you what you pay for. If you're looking to save money on hotels, go to the Circus Circus, Excalibur, Tropicana. If you're looking to be pampered and drop nearly $1K on a two-night weekend stay in Vegas, go to the Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, Wynn (all very nice hotels and worth the price, mind you). This hotel is perfect for those who don't want to pay too much money for a hotel that is pretty nice. However, with all that said, I feel that if you're trying to stay at a pretty nice hotel without spending TOO MUCH money, I might refer you to the Paris, as it is situated nearly in the center of the strip and is nearly at the same overall value as this hotel. Nonetheless, this is a great hotel/casino, and I would recommend it to anyone.	4	3	-1	4	5	3	-1	5

Parking the car was easy in the free carpark garage with a lift to the hotel. The problem was we had to drag our luggage all the way from the lift, up a hallway, through the casino and around to the reception. A long way when you are tired and have numerous suitcases/bags. Surely there could be a better way. I got a good deal through a 90 hour discount period through the hotel website and was great price. When we arrived the line to check in was extremely long to check in but after reading reviews that is the case with most Las Vegas hotels. Casino was very smoky but again that is said to be the same for all Las Vegas Hotels. The lady we got to check us in was very nice and helpful. I was so happy that the elevators were not far from the lobby and the hotel was easy to navigate. Even though I did not book a room with a view, I still received a strip view room (with view of mirage volcano) at no extra charge. Room was very clean. Shower had nice pressure. No noise once on our room floor.<br/><br/>We received a 2 for 1 coupon for the buffet and a 2 for cocktail for use at one of the bars, which is part of the resort fee. Computers to print airline boarding pass also part of resort fee. Resort fee clearly stated when booking. The buffet was huge and good food, although waiters had hard time keeping tables clear of plates. Used the coupon along with another half price coupon I received as part of booking deal. Cost us USD24 for 3 adults and 1 child. GREAT desserts, heaps of choice. There is a tram that goes from TI to the Mirage which is nice. On checkout, the lady got confused and charged the wrong card causing me to incur bank charges which didn't impress me. But all in all a great time at this hotel. The only other issue I had was that the TI sirens show wasn't operating and yet that was part of our resort fee and still charged for.<br/>Was able to do express checkout on the tv which was so helpful.	4	5	-1	5	5	3	-1	5

Better than we expected!	4	0	Upon reading the many reviews about this hotel we were afraid of what we would get. Even my boss warned me about the distinct odor of the rooms. When we first arrived we instantly knew that we were misinformed. The staff was extremely helpful and explained every question we had about the fees that would appear on our bill. The hotel ran out of single rooms but gave us a huge room with two beds that was fantastic. We had an awesome view of the desert-like mountains, the street below and other Vegas landmarks. Of course we didn't spend too much time in our hotel room but it was awesome to come back to a clean and chic room to sleep (and recover). Like all the hotels in Vegas the downstairs casino at T.I. was sometimes a little too smoky for my everyday liking but hey! we were in Vegas! Overall I was delighted by T.I. It was obvious that this hotel wasn't as fancy and had less attractions as all the others but it felt like 'home' for the 5 nights we stayed.<br/><br/>Oh and the buffet at T.I. was DELICIOUS!	4	4	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

We stayed in a petite suite thanks to a great Black Friday deal my husband found. The room was large and the two bathrooms were nice. The room did show some wear and tear though. Closet door were beat up and luggage scuffs on the walls were less than desirable. The room was very clean. The curtains failed to meet in the middle when closed making for early wake-ups with the sun peaking through. We would stay here again because the room was clean, the staff was fabulous and the location was great...just as long as we got a good deal. I should also note that the pool was closed, the spa &amp; fitness center closed at 3pm, the Isla restaurant was closed for remodeling, and their Siren Show was closed due to renovation.	4	4	-1	3	4	4	-1	2

I think when you are on a holiday, you know that you are leaving your comfortable bed and pillow to go and, TRY to get used to another bed. Well, not at this hotel....the beds are SWEET!!! They are actually known for this, but seriously the beds are THAT good! Ok, are beds really that important???? YES, especially in Vegas!! We must of walked 7 miles a day at the Cowboy Xmas alone, drank too much, ate too much and stayed out late too much...BUT when you hit that beautiful bed....well, zzzzzzzzzz all the way to morning....and it was very quiet! We are from the country and the only thing we here is the wind....so if the rooms weren't sound proof...we would know!!<br/>You have some very cool restaurants, try the fancy Mexican one with the bar in the front...FANTASTIC!!! Expensive, but amazing authentic mexican! <br/>Kahunaville is the only way to go for breakfast!!!! Coffee sucks and is very expensive so don't order it...but the $7.99 breaky is 3 eggs, huge thick slab of ham (you could have bacon or saugage) 2 pieces of toast and cubed potatoes!!!! yummo!!!<br/>Lastly, location...location...location!!!! TI is so central....and in Vegas, that is VERY important!<br/>So have fun and book here....very worth it!<br/>(We were on the 24th floor with a strip view!!!)	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

We have been here before and this year (2011) was quite nice. TI has changed hands in the last few years so Casino Perks are not as good as in previous years. 2011 weather played a big part in crowds because it was so nice and not cold at all. TI has made changes but if you can get past the linens not changing daily except by request you won't have too many problems. Rooms are spacious and since we had 2 one with accommodations it worked out well. Staff is exceptionally helpful and try to meet all of your requests. Our room on the 12th floor south gave us a fantastic view of the fireworks that Las Vegas puts on each year. So I would say ringing in the new year in Vegas try to get your room at TI in the South Tower. Location is good with the Tram to the Mirage running late night, Walgreen's across the street is now selling liquor for those who wish to have thier own and is also open 24 hours. <br/>So TI is great for a vacation even with the change of hands. If you want perks try the MLIFE group. TI will eventually have to improve or they will lose thier regulars who come for the gambling perks.	4	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

For one night, a place to sleep, it was acceptable. The rooms were very clean except the carpet had a large and mysterious wet spot in one corner. All of our eating and playing was done at the Venetian. The resort fee, although only $25, is a waste of money. We used nothing that the resort fee covered.	3	5	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

We originally reserved a petite suite and was told they only had a king and a pull out sofa. We got there and was told the only petite suite availalbe had two queens. This actually worked out better for us as we had our teenage daughter with us. The room had two bathrooms; one had a shower the other had a jacuzzi tub. The room was clean, large and nicely set up. No coffee maker in the room though. We asked for a high room and was given the 31 floor facing south. This enabled us to have a good view of the strip.<br/><br/>Food at the TI was disappointing. We ate at the coffee shop, buffet and pizza. I felt it was overpriced and not that great. However, Las Vegas has changed over the years and everything is much more expenisve now. The location is good in that you are able to walk or take the city bus (easy) to any location you want to visit. <br/><br/>Upon arriving the check-in line was long but it didn't really take that long to get through the line.

Despite offers of discounts from other hotels, there's a friendliness that begins when you check in (thank you Brieanne) and even when you sit to spend a few quarters in the morning (lovely Rita knew our names by Day 2 when she brought us our 1st coffees of the day). There's a lot to be said for that personal touch, and the folks at Treasure Island seem to have remembered that. Fun dining at Gilley's plus a sumptuous and reasonable buffet make TI the Treasure that its name implies. And can we say - quietest sleep we've had in Vegas EVER. We will definitely spend our nights (and yes, our quarters) at this Vegas gem again. Happy New Year all!	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Even with the added &quot;resort fee&quot; it worked out to be a better deal. Other hotels charge for the Internet per device/per day which obviously adds up, since we all have our own devices. We used the coupon for the lunch buffet and it was decent. We had a room in the west wing so were able to see down the entire strip. When arriving at the check in there was a very long line up, but it moved very fast.<br/>I would definatly stay here again. Beds were fantastic.	5	4	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

They took care in making the bathrooms especially nice and functional with easy access to Kleenex tissues and bathroom necessities, including the assortment of shampoo, conditioner, soap, body wash, and even hand cream.<br/>The staff we had contact with was most helpful and helped make our stay even more pleasant.<br/>The casino is smallish, compared to others in the neighborhood, and the choice of colors, to match the pirate them, is overly dark, in my opinion. The expansion of a country western-themed restaurant and entertainment center, complete with a mechanical bull, turned out to be fun, by luring customers with drink specials throughout the evening and karaoke nights to liven things up.<br/>The location is great- right on the strip, close to the mall, shops, casinos and numerous restaurants &amp; eateries. And the tram to/from the Mirage was a welcome relief after walking the strip all day.<br/>The down side is the resort fee, which they did not impose the last time we stayed there. It's a tricky way for the hotel to charge more for your stay than you expected. Read the fine print carefully.	3	5	-1	4	5	4	-1	4

By signing up for discounts on their website I was able to get a GREAT room rate on a Tower Suite. It was fantastic! Great view of the Sirens show from above, HUGE room, two bathrooms (one with a jacuzzi tub), and when I mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary at check-in they had a complimentary bottle of champagne delivered to the room. <br/><br/>There was one problem, the bed was absolutely awful. So why the &quot;excellent&quot; rating? Because I walked down to the front desk to let them know and they had the mattress changed. No, we didn't get a brand new mattress but the one we got was absolutely acceptable and I applaud them for taking care of us. <br/><br/>Thanks TI, we will definitely be returning!	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	4

I had a incident were my boyfriend left with my cousins to party on the strip and took the valet ticket with him. I went downstairs and had to fill out a form and show identification to get my car which wasnt a problem and my car was brought up promptly. I was very happy with the day time valet service. The next evening which was Monday Jan. 2 me and my boyfriend was rushing out our room to get to the Marquee Night Club and left our valet ticket in the room. So I had to fill out the form for people who dont have a valet ticket and showed my identification again, which wasnt an issue. This little [--] who claims he was the manager over valet parking start asking me all kind of questions and then told me I should of brought my valet ticket and I wouldnt have this problem. Now remember I had been left without my valet ticket before and had to fill out the form and show my id and my car was brought up promptly. This lil jack hammer took 45 mins to get my car up there and I was the only person in valet picking up a car. I went inside to speak to his superior and a female came out and I cant remember her name because she was so clueless she had me ticked. Anyway she called and asked the lil jack hammer what happened and he gave his side of the story and lied and told the clueless lady that I told him I had a problem showing my id and didnt show it the day before. I had never told the jack hammer that and I am sure if they gave people without tickets cars without id there will be alot of stolen vehicles in their casino. So she hang up wit him and tell me she going to talk to who I got my car from the day before without id. I told her dumb behind are you seriously letting him off the hook with that lie after he was just arguing with me because I left my ticket in the room. I also had to let her know that the people the day before did take my id thats how the hell I got my car duh. Anyway besides that the hotel was nice but they need to upgrade the towels because they are thin and hard like Motel 6.	3	3	-1	4	4	3	-1	3

We arrived at TI before 9am and was greeted by someone with a beanie asking to take our luggage. He turned out to be a bellhop with a track top over his uniform, so we were not sure if he was a staff of the hotel or not. Then we were told that check in was at 12 noon! There was no crowd but no one was interested to check us in until 12 noon. So we left our luggage with the bell hop and came back just before 12 noon. Shock horror, the queue to checkin was 4 lines deep, about over 100 people in front of us... Disneyland style. We finally got into our room close to 2 pm. Late lunch about 430pm at the buffet with a hotel voucher 2 for 1. <br/>Then overall, it was smoky even though we had non smoking rooms. We had to walk past the smoky casino to get to our elevator to the hotel rooms. <br/>We had to queue for the buffet on our second day. The sirens show was right below our room which was great as the fireworks came right up past our window.<br/>Overall it was disappointing because we chose TI as we thought there would be some activity for our teens. The pool was closed too.	2	3	-1	3	3	2	-1	4

Great dealers Ante,Chris and so many more if I didn't mention your name sorry. Cleaning staff is very friendly and even though sometimes they might not understand they do there best or get someone else to help. Asked for more clothes hangers and they brought up right away. Only one thing I could say I didn't enjoy is the buffet the food is great however the line ups were long at the stations,not a well layed out buffet,also could really use a different menu get a litlle much that its the same thing day after day. I understand breakfast being the same but supper should be different each night. We rented a car and had no problems finding a parking spot at the hotel.

The accommodations were very comfortable. We did have to get a clock for the room after checking in and getting to the room. It?? becoming one of the older hotel/casinos on the main strip area so it?? not as glitzy as the Palazzo, Encore, Venetian, or ARIA. But it?? not as old as Imperial Place, Flamingo, or Harrah??. It?? pretty much right in the middle depending on what you are looking for in a place to stay. We found out during this trip that the owners of the old Frontier that was imploded a few years ago now own TI, which is probably why Gilley?? western bar/club is there and the nightclub Tangerine gone. But there are still plenty of places alone the strip for your preference of nightlife. On the strip is where we prefer to be and this located suited us just fine. Overall, we found TI is a very nice place for a long weekend stay.	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

We got our room for about $65 Wed and Thurs night and $85 for Friday night with their 99 hour promotion - included two free buffets. Our room was spacious, clean and quiet. Loved having two bathrooms! We went to the buffet for lunch and were surprisingly pleased with the selections - especially enjoyed the desserts - red velvet cupcakes! Everyone we encountered was very friendly to the woman who checked us in to the housekeeping staff. Good location on the strip.	5	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

No Clocks-Not Enough Towels or Toiletries. Service at the Front Desk especially at the Bell desk was fabulous.<br/>House keeping was very friendly.Felt very safe, after 10:30 in order to get to the elevator you had to show you room card..I thought that was great idea. Not a very busy casino. Not much happening compared to the rest of the strip.<br/>Casino was always well kept BUT there was never a bar maid to be found, in the 5 days we stay @ TI I ran into one on our last day!?<br/>The Buffet Breakfast was Really Good alot of choses - Just make sure you get there early or else you could be waiting in line for a while. I love starbucks coffee BUT I was totally shocked they charges $1.50 for a cup of hot water. <br/>Over ALL A pleasant stay..Good location on the strip	3	3	-1	3	3	4	-1	4

Fantastic!<br/>Still cant believe how great the hotel is for the price.<br/><br/>the only downside is if you have something shipped to you at the hotel.<br/>nobody really knew where the packages were, what the policy is on unclaimed packages, the charges per box..... if you arent sending anything, youll be fine. if so get a managers name ahead of time. aside from the that youll love your stay.	5	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

First impression of T.I is that it was nice. My boyfriend and i didn't pay for a strip view (since it's an added expense) but we did get a corner room facing Encore, Wynn, palazzo and the fashion show mall and we were able to watch the pirate show from our room. For paying for a non strip view room and getting a good view i was pleased!! Another good thing is that it was a easy walk to the fashion show mall, and their is a tram that takes you to the mirage. After a long day of walking, it's very convenient that the elevators to the room isn't a long maze walk through slot machines. (Mirage hotel elevators were a hassle.) Room was nice and clean. MAJOR pro of T.I is that we received 4 free buffet passes. Buffet had a variety of delicious food. CONS of T.I would be that the sheets would give of static to my hair and i would get shocked. The sheets weren't the best! Another con would be the tv channels, They offer no good channels. They had to USB outlet on the tv. (Would be useful to plug in laptop so we can watch a movie since channels were lame.) For the most part T.I is a great hotel.	4	5	-1	5	4	5	-1	4

The hotel is very busy and in a great place on the strip. The pirate shows are great and we could see part of them from our room. For an incredibley noisy city I found the stay at Treasure Island very quiet once you were in your suite. I encountered this problem evrywhere in Amercia!! not everyne drinks coffee so I was so frustrated that I went out and bought a kettle. The hotel does not have a guest laundry but provides a laundry services. I would stay again without any problems. You cant not love Vegas and this hotel ticked all the boxes and situated out the front was a travel info cart which provided all free must sees along the strip.	4	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

It's in a great location on the strip but that's just about the only compliment I can honestly pay it. I don't think I am a very fussy traveler but I would like to be honest. Check in took quite a while, which didn't really bother me but I was only checking in from another hotel and not from a long flight. When we first arrived at the room, I thought it was a little dated but not bad for your money as the rooms are inexpensive. On a closer look, I found black hairs almost everywhere in the bathroom which can't be mine as I am very blond! The flannels and towels were as old as the hotel and had a constant stink of bleach. The window was small and there wasn't much view and the internet that you pay $20 + tax a day resort fee for was very inconsistent. To be fair they did send a mechanic up to help with this and he was a very nice chap but it had fixed itself by the time he got there. When we went to print our boarding passes off the computer wouldn't work so we had to pay $5 elsewhere.<br/>If I went to Vegas again, I would be prepared to maybe pay a little bit more to stay somewhere nicer, but if you are on a budget you might get lucky with Treasure Island but you might need to turn a blind eye to a few things.	3	5	-1	3	2	3	-1	2

Trough the years TI has been up and down regarding maintenance,cleaningness and service and unfortunately it seems that this time we are on the downswing again. Casino carpet is absolutely filthy,so is the casino air in general. Breakfast buffet is now at 16 dollars and it's a very basic one compared to the well known Bellagio one wich comes at 15 dollars with an amazing selection. We had a free dinner buffet to use and I'm glad it was free : the TI dinner buffet is once again back to it's early years when the place was still under Wynn's Mirage Resorts : disgusting. Rooms are still kept in good conditions but furnitures are showing some age. Most of the decorations vases and fake plants in the elevator halls are now gone giving the place a pretty basic and worn look. Of course not complaints for 23 Euro per night,but that was just a sale rate I've got by chance.	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	5	-1	-1

However happy to confirm that the room and bathroom were very clean. The beds were comfy, the staff was helpful and friendly. It was very quiet, we did not experience any issues with noise level. The hotel itself has less attractions within compared to other hotels such as Mirage or Bellagio but than again they come with a higher price tag so overall it was a great stay and loved our room!<br/><br/>The best tip for people that want to go nightclubs just walk around in the evening and you will find many places offering wristbands free for girls and discounted rate for guys at many places such as LAX, lavo, Revolution at Mirage. You will also find people that give out free VIP passes on the streets and will ask for a tip in exchange for them, If you have one of wristabands or passes it will make it a breeze to enter club no waiting VIP access!	5	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

The check-in line was absurdly long but they did a wonderful job of having enough staff there to make things move smoothly. The common areas of the hotel are nice looking but clearly not the most up-to-date - I was fine with this. The rooms, however, have been redone wonderfully and I was really impressed with the decor.

Our room was fantastic with an amazing strip view, on the 18th floor. that was the good stuff, now the bad ones, the casino area has a really bad smell, like cigarette mixed with deodorant, if you have allergies, avoid this casino, and the other thing, the staff is efficent but not courteous and polite.

There was a good amount of families when I was there and not a great nightlife scene. So I would suggest leaving for any night time activities. There are better restaurants out there too then staying at the hotel to eat. The Pirate show in front of the hotel was pretty good though.	4	4	-1	3	3	4	-1	3

I have visited Las Vegas at least 100 times in the past 30 years. Last stayed this New Years. Had a great time.<br/><br/>Vegas is about FUN. The shows, the gambling, the restaurants, the clubs, and tons of other stuff. And it's about the awesome casino/hotels. But it is NOT about staying in your room. <br/><br/>Enjoy the hotels and their restaurants. Go to their shows....drink at the bars....gamble at their tables. But do NOT spend an arm and a leg to simply pass out at night. How much time did the guys in the Hangover spend in THEIR room?<br/><br/>Treasure Island is great. Modern, clean, stylish, and sexy. And it is across from the Wynn, the Fashion Center, and the Venetian....with a free shuttle that goes to the Mirage.<br/><br/>Vegas rooms are all the same. And no one spends any time in them. Save your money and see a show or have a great dinner instead of staying in a 5-star hotel you will be visiting anyway. Treasure Island will NOT disappoint. Trust me.	5	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	4

The rooms were a good size but when we got to the room we noticed that the glasses in the bathroom weren't clean and actually had lipstick stains. The small bottles of soaps were dirty and looked used and there was no waste basket in the washroom. Plus the safe didn't work and none of the direct dial connections on the phone worked. There were also a few small stains on the curtains in the room and on the shower. While we were there the glasses were cleaned but no wastebasket was put in the bathroom and our ice bucket was never emptied. <br/><br/>None of these are big issues at all but its unusual to have a number of them and for me, the dirty glasses skeeved me out and made me wonder what I couldn't see. <br/><br/>Otherwise the hotel was pretty good but nothing exceptional. It is fairly small and easy to get around. Ate at pho for breakfast for two mornings and it was good. Isla was good for a margarita and appetizers. Another restaurant (don't remember the name but had a water feature) had average food and was not a good choice for breakfast - not great food and kind of depressing in the morning.<br/><br/>Good location across from the Venetian and the shopping mall. Next year I think we might try out the Mirage or the Venetian.	3	4	-1	3	2	3	-1	4

Our flight from the UK landed early afternoon so we were able to check in straight away with a minimal wait, there were at least 8 people checking guests in. <br/><br/>We've been to Vegas twice before this trip so we were familiar with the casino part of TI, which is fairly standard of most casinos on the strip. But we were really impressed with our room which had obviously been refurbished in the past year or two and in no way resembled the dark, slightly tired impression of the gaming floor. We'd asked for a view of the strip and were facing the Venetian from the 31st floor. A large room with a super comfy king size bed and an excellent marble bathroom. Housekeeping and service during our stay was impeccable. <br/><br/>As per most places on the strip, there is a resort fee on top of the rate. However, we found that the resort fee was offset by the access to the gym (husband went once and reported that it was decent), a 2 for 1 voucher on the TI buffet, 2 for 1 cocktails and a free lunch or dinner to the buffet for the room guests. <br/><br/>We used our vouchers for the buffet for our first dinner when we were pretty jetlagged and just wanted to eat in the hotel. The buffet is decent, it doesn't have a huge range in comparison to the Wynn or Bellagio but the food is generally decent quality with Asian, Italian, Pizza, BBQ, roast meat and salads. Desserts are excellent with fresh donuts and fairy floss, a bit hit with any child in the area!<br/><br/>Overall, we found the TI to be great and much better value with newer, larger rooms than some of the other hotels. We'd definitely stay there again	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Walking distance to the most popular casinos on the strip. Rooms are above average. Treasure Island is a very busy and crowded hotel. Think of &quot;New York City&quot;. This is not the place for kids; it is for adults that want to party and gamble. The pool is very small. The hotel wants you gambling not hanging at the pool. Food choices are good, and quality of food is excellent. You cannot go wrong with this hotel unless you want to relax. If you want the same location with a fantastic pool and a more relaxing atmosphere stay next door at the &quot;Mirage&quot;.	3	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

Checked in and did not get requested room type, was told for WIFI it would cost me 20.00 extra for the resort fee, which included using the gym. What BS is that??? When you are paying over 400.00 a night for a room, I would think they could at least offer up wifi and a pass to the gym. Upon arrival in the room, found it to be smelly and spotty cell phone coverage, the towels looked like they had been used and had a funky smell. I have sand paper in my garage that was softer than those towels. Hotel Casino had an obnoxious perfume / Smoke smell. I would have rather smelled straight smoke. I am a smoker and the odor in there was too much for me. The buffett was a joke, save your money and go elsewhere. I figured I would give it a try since I was able to score a two for one coupon. Not worth the hassle. Called the front desk to extend out a night and was told the rate was 199.00, so I extended because my GF was coming in. I decided to check rates online and found that online I could get the rate for 99.00... WTF is that? Went down to the desk and the girl was nice enough to adjust it. I was then told I HAD to pay for the resort fee, and it was not an option. Why not just include that in the price instead of adding 20.00 to my bill cause it was mandatory... This is the first and last time I will stay at TI...	2	5	-1	2	2	3	-1	4

I have stayed on the strip before, but it was my first time staying at TI. We stayed in a standard room with a strip view. I absolutely loved the room! It was clean and it was awesome coming back from a long night on the stip to a gogreous strip view from our window. We could even see the volcano erupting from the Mirage Hotel and the water show from Bellagio from our room window. The one thing that I was a little dissapointed about was the check in process. I also work at a hotel and the gentleman checking us in didn't speak of the amenities at the hotel or give us very much information. The package I had booked included a $50 gift certificate towards hotel shops, and he did not go over this with me at all during check in time.We also had to wait in line for almost an hour to check into our room. Overall the housekeeping staff was very kind and wonderful, and all other associates were very knowledgable as well. We really enjoyed the hotel and I can't wait to return.	5	5	-1	5	5	3	-1	5

There are hotels now that don't charge the resort tax - a saving of $200 + tax would have been for us for our 10 night stay. <br/>Take my advice - book a hotel that doesn't charge resort tax - and spend it on something worthwhile that YOU want to spend it on - not something for nothing!!!	2	3	-1	3	3	3	-1	2

If you want to be in the heart of the strip and get a decent rate, this is the place for you. I had not stayed here in years and I expected the rooms to be dated. Not at all. They were attractive, functional, and had a good bed. <br/><br/>My experiences with their customer service was limited to check out and check in, where they were efficient, friendly, and helpful. The casino was standard and the bars were good. The TI buffet was pretty sub-par, but I don't hold out much hope for Las Vegas buffets in general and wouldn't grade them down for that.<br/><br/>My only gripe is the pillows. Many hotels offer a combo of the long, thicker variety along with smaller, more conventional pillows. Our room only had the thicker type and it made for a bit of a rough night. With that out of my system I can say that the overall experience was better than I expected, and I'll stay here again - I'll just bring my own pillow.	4	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	3

We stayed in a Petite Suite with my family and could not have asked for a better way to spend Christmas.<br/><br/>ROOM:<br/>The Suite had a large living area with a king bed and sofa bed. There were two large bathrooms (one with a rain shower and the other with jacuzzi tub). The towels and sheets were really nice and very pleased with the room. The cleaning staff was very friendly and always around. It seemed like they were always cleaning. The shampoos/tolietries weren't so great but everything was above average. <br/><br/>STAFF:<br/>Literally, everyone we came in contact with was so nice. Bellman that delivered our luggage (and golf clubs) was very helpful about possible courses and offered to clean them. All top notch. Anytime we needed anything and called operator and or asked anyone, very nice. <br/><br/>LOCATION:<br/>I think it was a great location for &quot;The Strip&quot; action. Trolley to Mirage and/or walkway to Venetian and/or mall, it was really easy to get around. <br/><br/>FOOD:<br/>We ate at the steak house and deli. The steak house was amazing and appropriately priced for a steak house. My husband and I got Filets and a lot of sides and all were wonderful. We brought our son and they accommodated him with something off the menu as they didn't have a kids menu. The deli was standard but I did have to wait a long. <br/><br/>Definitely recommend this hotel. Some of the other hotels might be more popular and fancier but this hotel meets all your needs and they treat you well.

Stayed at TI. signed up online and got our room for $70/night (not including the mandatory $20+tax resort fee). The room was nice, we got a room on the 25th floor non strip view. Because of being on the 25th floor, we were able to take the &quot;Floor 25 - 30 elevators&quot; which was a lot faster and not as many stops. Got to TI at 12:45 pm Sat , and waited about 45 minutes for check-in.<br/><br/>Room included a small refridge but no coffee maker. We had brought a french press for coffee but soon realized that we had no way to get hot water (next time, we will bring a electric carafe that heats water).. Our room had darkening curtains which was nice and the beds are very comfortable. We liked staying at Ti, their casino seemed less big than Venetian and Caesars -- and seemed more manageable to navigate. Beds were very comfortable.<br/><br/>2. TI resort fee - mandatory fee. We really didn't use it for anything since we could use our phones for internet. We didn't go to the fitness center, the pool was closed, we didn't see the TI siren show. Only thing we used was the &quot;weekday only&quot; two for one buffet coupon (and if you are single or an odd number of people, you won't be able to use for everyone anyway. I thought I read that there are also 50% off coupons, but when I enquired, was told there weren't any). <br/><br/>The resort fee seems a waste of money, but if you figured it into for the cost of the room, it ended up being about $95/night -- not too bad (Hopefully, we get some discounted rooms at Ti or elsewhere next time, since we're now a member of their player clubs)<br/><br/>3. Player's clubs: TI gave us $10 free play, <br/><br/>4. Slots -- we had the best luck at Ti. I guess I am considered a very low roller and only planned to spend $100/ day. Lost $45 on Sat and $20 on Sun, and then had a little bit of luck Sun night and today. Overall, total damage was just $44 -- not bad at all for playing about 10-12 hours of slots total.<br/><br/>5. Free Casino Drinks. I made a list of drinks I wanted to try-- mostly including the sweeter ones such as Strawberry Dacquiri, Mudslide, Sex on the beach, Smith and Kearns. Found out that at Caesars' they don't do frozen drinks ( I had asked for a frozen strawberry dacquiri) which they do make for you at Ti - - - Caesar's drinks were a little bigger than TI's though. Favorite place for playing slots and getting drinks were TI, and I was able to get all the drinks mentioned earlier . . and of course, tipped $1/drink.<br/><br/>6. TI Reward points-- I am not sure how points are awarded. . .whether for length of time played or how much money spent. I accumulated 398 points at TI this weekend and have no idea whether that is a lot or a little for 2 days of playing. (I got more than h and d, even though we all played about the same amount of time and spent the same amount of money).<br/><br/>7. Car -- we took our car and was glad we did . esp for the convenience of having transportation (Most casinos offer free parking). You can do without a car, but you would do a lot more walking and taking the shuttle or tram. While we were there, the TI to Mirage tram was not working.<br/><br/>We liked TI , would stay there again, esp if we can get our room for the price we got it for this past weekend (We asked for late checkout too, and was told 12 noon was the latest they would extend it to).	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1

Customer service is nonexistent.	2	2	I thought I found a good deal through Priceline. Unfortunately the resort fee is $22 dollars per day and is mandatory, even though TI is not a resoert.The resort fee jacked up the price 50%. included in the resort fee is internet usage, gym access, and a single buy one, get one free drink. The gym is mediocre at best and the drink is a joke. Apparently resort fees are common in las Vegas now but there are lists of hotels that do not charge this fee. Check it out before booking. <br/>Also, I wanted to print one page from an email. The charge to do this would have been $10 to use the business center computer and 10 cents per page. I opted out after talking to the manager.<br/>The website mentioned a heated pool so I asked where to find and was told that it was closed for maintenance. When I said customers should be told this when checking in I was told that it has been closed since December. <br/>Customer service does nonexistent in this hotel.	2	3	-1	3	3	1	-1	3

Our room was nice, we requested rooms next to each other and were able to get them. It was my first time to Vegas and my 50th birthday so they gave us 2 bottles of complimentary champagne. The beds were very comfortable. There was a safe and fridge, but no coffee maker or microwave. We bought bottled water across the street at Walgreens, the water in Vegas is awful. The room and bathroom was spacious, we were on the 33rd floor with a strip view - it was beautiful. We never did see the &quot;Sirens of TI&quot; as we were always at another casino during their show time. Only played slots - did okay, had a more fruitful experience at the Golden Nugget. If you want to drink while gambling - you need to scope out where the waitresses are - or you will never get a drink.<br/><br/>We ate at the Coffee Shop, food was okay, basic, nothing special. We got in late on Friday night, went into Kahunaville, no food available (too late), but we were able to order drinks as long as we were at the bar. Bartenders very friendly (they seem to be hard to find in Vegas - nice bartenders). We did have dinner one night at Isla - again food was okay, nothing to brag about, but the staff was friendly. Buy your coffee at Starbucks - one inside and one outside, much better than the expensive coffee you pay for in the hotel.<br/><br/>I would stay again, but would like to try out some of the other hotels we saw.	4	4	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

It used to be a Caribbean theme hotel, now the rooms are very hippster modern and the hotel seems to be trying to run as fast as they can away from the tropical motif. The end result is a hotel that seems to not know what it is and just blends in with all the other hipster garbage (mocha wood, modern furniture, modern lighting fixtures) that you see everywhere else. I picked this hotel for a more traditional feel like it used to have, but instead I got a cold/cheap modern feel.<br/><br/>All in all the room was fine, but I wish it was still like it used to be. Good location and nice property.	3	4	-1	3	4	4	-1	3

Rooms are pretty well priced and the location is convenient right on the strip. The resort fee is compulsory for all guests, but this comes with free internet so if you need that, might be a good deal depending on your needs.<br/><br/>The internet access is quite confusing where you have to agree to pay some extra charges per day but these charges will not appear in your final bill.<br/><br/>The hot and cold water was swapped around in my room which was confusing. When you turn on the hot water tap cold water comes out and when you turn on the cold water tap hot water comes out.<br/><br/>There is a Starbucks in this hotel and a 24 hour Starbucks right outside. There's also a reasonably priced pizza place in the hotel.<br/><br/>Overall good value, I would stay again if I can get the same prices.	5	4	-1	4	4	3	-1	4

We stayed at TI the Tues and Wed right before New Years Eve, and got a super great price on a suite. We only paid about $100 a night, which was what other hotels offered for their basic rooms, and we had over 900 square feet, 2 huge bathrooms, a fridge (not the mini bar type either), and the fireworks from the pirate show they do soared upto our window on the hour every night. <br/><br/>We were very close to a huge, reasonably priced mall, and were able to walk over the the venetian and caesars easily. I would have given TI five stars but for a few reasons:<br/><br/>The maid had left a few things uncleaned around our room when we checked in (they sent her up to fix it though). And the check in itself took forever! We stayed before and it took forever then too, so I'm assuming this is an ongoing problem they have. Also, the shopping and food inside the hotel itself leaves a little to be desired, but you can just walk across the street and find lots of great places to go to, so that's not a huge prob.<br/><br/>For the value of the room, I would have to say they have the nicest room for your dollar on the strip, in fact if not for the need for variety I'd probably stay there everytime. <br/><br/>***If you want to get their best prices you have to sign up for their emails. I also use &quot;smartervegas.com&quot; a lot.***	5	4	-1	5	3	3	-1	5

They will show you a list of what it supposedly covers, but read the find print and it's llittle more than internet access and a newspaper you have to come down and get from the lobby...if there are any. Use the gym and get hit with a $17 locker fee, etc, etc. It's Vegas.<br/><br/>Since Internet service in my room never worked and tech services couldn't find out why, I demanded the fee be refunded. Grouch at front desk had to call the supervisor, but I got my money back. <br/><br/>Shuttles from airport seem to sometimes go to TI and sometimes not. Cab fare is about $25 each way, but steel yourself for cranky, rude cab drivers. They get specially trained in insults before they are allowed to drive. They too have discovered the benefits of add-on fees. <br/><br/>All in all, if you don't have to go, don't.	3	3	-1	3	3	1	-1	3

My trip lasted from 12/27/2011 to 01/01/2012. The purpose of the trip was twofold, of course to celebrate the New Year, but more importantly, we were there to celebrate my cousin?? 30th birthday. My overall hope for the vacation was that it would be a memorable experience that we would never forget in celebrating her 30th birthday; the trip was of course memorable, but not for the aforementioned reasons. <br/>Immediately upon check in the line was extensive and I waited for nearly an hour to complete my check in, I can deal with this and understand considering the festivities. However, upon check in and arriving into our room, the room was a mess. The bed was not made and there were dirty underwear from the previous guest hanging in the restroom. Furthermore, there were no clean towels in the restroom, and the IPOD alarm clock that was promised on the website was nonexistent in the room. In fact, there was no clock present in the room upon check in. <br/>After noticing these inconsistencies from my previous stay at Treasure Island only two weeks prior (12/6/2011-12/18/2011), I immediately contacted the front desk to inform them of my dissatisfaction. After speaking with the front desk, I was instructed that I needed to contact housekeeping to inform them of the problems in my room. After making the call to housekeeping, they showed up to my room nearly 3 hours later to clean the room. They also left an alarm clock that was not an IPOD docking clock. I immediately called the front desk regarding this matter, and they informed me that they no longer carry the IPOD docking clocks, I found this interesting though, considering my room from 2 weeks prior and all of my other party?? room contained the IPOD docking alarm clock. <br/>Another issue arose during the check out process. Upon cleaning my room and getting ready to checkout, I noticed that some of my personal items were missing. Only 2 days prior, my cousin and I took a trip to the Miracle Miles shopping mall and purchased some couture lollipops from the Sugar Factory. While cleaning our room, we noticed that this bag was missing. During the checkout process, we notified the concierge who redirected us to speak with security. The security officer who was extremely helpful informed us that we needed to speak with a manager at the property, and that if they couldn?? come to a resolution then we could file a claim with security. Once we returned to the check out desk, we spoke with a different concierge who stated that she spoke with the manager and they agreed to credit our room for the missing items totaling over $125. The concierge stated that the manager was not available to speak with us immediately, but stated that he would be available in roughly 20 minutes or so. Considering I had a flight to board, I informed the concierge that I would not be able to wait; otherwise I would miss my flight. She then informed me that she would place a note on my account and a hotel manger would contact me regarding the matter and ensure the credit to my account was successful. <br/>After arriving home, I waited roughly 72 hours after my checkout to receive a call. Once I didn?? receive a call, I contacted your establishment only to be transferred five different times, and ultimately informed that there was no manager present and I would have to receive a return phone call. Well, here we are nearly 3 weeks later and I have not received a phone call from any of the staff at Treasure Island. This entire experience has been disheartening and frustrating. I initially bought the items from Sugar Factory as souvenirs for my young nieces along with some other items for friends. Considering I spent well over $100 for the souvenirs, $800 for my 4 night stay during New Years, and an additional $200 for my stay during the 2 weeks prior, I find the level of service unacceptable and sub-par at best. And even though I?? presently planning a trip to Vegas in May for my 30th birthday, I am confident and saddened to say that I will not be returning to Treasure Island for my celebration. I would appreciate it if the initial agreement arrived with the hotel staff was acknowledged, in which my credit card will be credited the $125 for my missing items and overall inconvenience.	3	5	-1	3	2	1	-1	4

There is just too much on offer in Las Vegas to put up with shoddy service and contradictory staff. <br/><br/>As an independent in a heavily affiliated marketplace (eg, MGM, Caesars et al) I would have expected TI's standards to be getting better - alas, they have consistently dropped. <br/><br/>Lots of small issues (and not so small) become big issues, it's all cumulative - again, especially in a marketplace as big and offering as much variety as Vegas. <br/><br/>As &quot;foreigners&quot; we try and play the game when in the US and tip appropriately (and often). Mid-stay on this trip we forgot to leave the tip on the pillow and returned to our room to find our toiletries strewn across the bathroom bench. I guess we needed reminding! <br/><br/>Other &quot;guests&quot; had obviously ignored the house rules and smoked in the lift lobby of our floor. The butts and ash remained in situ for three days. We don't condone the misbehaviour of others but this was just slackness by the housekeeping staff. <br/><br/>On three separate occasions we were (badly) misinformed by front desk staff in terms of room availability. <br/><br/>There appears to be a distinct lack of communication between hotel staff and casino staff these days. One group is happy to blame the other and vice versa when promises are made and broken. The common response is &quot;we are separate businesses&quot;. As guests we expect a transparent operation between hotel and casino - after all it is the TI Hotel AND Casino. <br/><br/>The final straw for us was the lack of consistency with previous stays with particular regard to the ubiquitous &quot;resort fee&quot;. It didn't cost us sheep stations in additional charges but that is not the point - a statement that a fee is to be waived is just that - I don't expect to hear that &quot;this is not part of the resort fee anymore&quot;. As I mentioned to a staff member &quot;I may be green but I'm not a vegetable!&quot;. <br/><br/>It embarrasses me to think of the number of people that we have sent to TI in good faith over the years. They have probably been let down as well. <br/><br/>Over the road to The Palazzo next year!	3	5	-1	3	2	1	-1	3

With Wynn, Encore and the Fashion mall right next to it, Treasure Island is not so out of the way now. We had a good room, and we got it at a very good price as well. We could see the show and fireworks below from our room. The staff is decent and helpful. There are newer casinos in the Vegas strip, that are nicer than TI. But if you find a good deal on a room, don't let it pass. I would say this place has more value for money.	4	3	-1	4	5	4	-1	4

I like TI; it's a solid choice and has the best location on the Strip. TI came up as my mystery Expedia 4-star choice for $42/night (I'd paid $40/night via Expedia's mystery-hotel feature a couple of years ago), and at that low price, the TI was one of the better bargains I've enjoyed in Vegas. <br/><br/>As with my previous stay, the helpful front-desk clerk listened to my requests (upper-floor, away-from-elevator, nonsmoking room) and gave me an upgrade to a Strip-view room. The view was lovely (from the 24th floor), and while connecting, the room was quiet. It was also very comfortable, and while some of the furnishing and decor were a bit tired, everything worked and looked fine. The bed, a king, was supremely comfy, although the sheets were a bit scratchy -- no Frette linens here, but I didn't expect 800-thread count at $42/night. Although the room was just the basic &quot;Deluxe&quot; (about 395 sf, I think), it was spacious -- and the bathroom was bigger than those in many 5-star hotels. No separate walk-in shower, but the tub was huge, and I appreciated the curved curtain rod. The bathroom was marble, and the fixtures were of good quality.<br/><br/>I liked the older climate-control unit: wall-mounted, chest-high box with high/low/off fan settings and a crude but effective sliding warm-cold control on the right of the little box. I like the fan on for white noise, and TI's unit worked very well in this regard: fan stayed on while set temperature (within a range of a few degrees) was maintained.<br/><br/>Maid service was good; nothing in particular to note.<br/><br/>TI's resort fee is $20/night plus tax, and and with all Vegas hotels, that's on top of whatever basic nightly rate you end up paying. While a bit steep, these fees are common in Vegas, with even cheaper hotels often tacking them on. At TI, the RF at least nets you a good internet service (I experienced between 4 and 8 MBPS) and several other amenities (health-club/gym use), which you may or may not end up using. (I did use the boarding-pass printing service and free local and 800-number calls.) <br/><br/>TI's casino is pretty good; lots of slots and not too smoky.<br/><br/>I ate at both the Coffee Shop and Buffet -- good, but not great -- what you'd expect for mainstay restaurants at a 4-star hotel. <br/><br/>I think TI's self-parking garage may be the best on the Strip: it's right behind the hotel, and it's a short walk to the hotel's casino. I also used the valet a couple of times and found the valet guys (and girls) to be friendly and quick.<br/><br/>TI's strongest suit after its rooms may be its prime Strip location: connected via short walkways to the Fashion Show Mall, Venetian, and Mirage; and right off I-15 (via Spring Mtn. Rd.).<br/><br/>In sum, I highly recommend TI; it does almost everything right. The rooms and location are particularly strong points. I didn't have to wait to check in (but this was on a Monday on what seemed to be a fairly quiet week in Vegas), and value for price paid (at least what I paid) was very high. <br/><br/>In sum, I highly recommend	5	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	5

And i was surprised with how nice they were. Very clean and kept clean daily. Had flat screen tv, safe and decent bathroom.<br/><br/>Casino-Was small BUT when your in a town full of casino who cares, <br/><br/>Location-Location was decent, walking distance to a lot of other casino's and stuff. Anywhere your staying in vegas be prepared to walk. No matter how conveniant the location.<br/><br/>Pool-pool was kinda small and crowded, drinks were crazily expensive, didint spent to much time in the pool cause of this.<br/><br/>Restaurants-I didint mind the deli BUT be prepared to eat a lot. Im a big eater and i could barely finish a sandwich. The other restaurants were ok but once again your surrounded by about 10 thousand restaurants of all different kinds, If you dont like what they have there go elsewhere.<br/><br/>Bars-When your main goal going to vegas is to drink then any bar is a good bar.<br/><br/>Overall great affordable stay, would stay here again for sure.	4	3	-1	3	4	3	-1	4

This resort has been excellent! They have rooms with track lifts - you can bring your own sling and it makes travel so much easier. The pool also has a lift although it is very old and could be upgraded. The staff at the hotel have been extremely helpful and the guys at the pool also have assisted when the pool lift would not work (which has been two of the three times we have been there). Hopefully they will get it fixed soon as we want to come back again when it is warmer! Great location, comfortable and great food. Vegas is a wonderful spot to vacation with someone who is physically disabled - cabs come frequently and the shows and shopping make for a fun fun trip.	5	5	-1	5	4	4	-1	5

Not that anything was glaringly bad, but comparatively speaking, it?? about the last place on the strip I?? like to stay in again. It was kind of old and dingy. Nothing modern or fun. The crowd was the same. The nightlife within the casino was non-existent. The casino itself was drab and dreary. The food options were not very good. And I found the service in and around the casino quite rude and generally not pleasant. I was playing table games and slots had virtually no drink service and when I did it was some grumpy old lady, boobs to her waist, mad at the world, mad at Las Vegas, mad at serving tourists drinks. Spent some time at Planet Hollywood and what a difference (yes, I know there?? cost difference too). But I got served drinks quickly. Frequently. Nicely. <br/><br/>The rooms themselves were totally fine. The beds were comfy and the showers had nice pressure. Just the experience was below average. Spend a tad more to go to PH, Caesar??, Mirage ?	2	4	-1	3	3	1	-1	4

It's location was convenient to the convention (LVCC) and to everything on the Strip! We were promptly checked in around 6pm (some reviewers have posted long lines, but we did not experience this) on a Saturday. We had a package that had been delivered and the Front Desk Agent quickly retrieved it for us. <br/><br/>Room: Our room was very clean and spacious. We opted for an upgraded strip view and it was well worth it. Our sink was not draining properly, but the Maintenance person was up promptly to fix it. Our room was towards the end of the hall, but very easy to get to. There are separate elevators to different floors to eliminate a long wait. Our room was serviced each day. <br/><br/>Location: Great location with easy access to the Strip! We don't mind walking and found this hotel the most convenient that we've stayed in. There is a tram that takes you to the Mirage to cut some walking time. <br/><br/>Food: There are several restaurants at the hotel. We ate at Kahunaville once in the evening and twice for breakfast (you can eat bfast outside by the pool which we loved!!!). The atmosphere at night was really fun as well!!! We ate at the Coffee Shop a few times as well...we were hooked on their chicken fingers! We did not eat at Gilley's, but went there one night and had a really great time. We went to Phil's Italian Steakhouse for happy hour but did not receive a warm welcome from the bartender so we left right away. There is also a Starbucks for morning coffee (no coffee maker in the room).<br/><br/>Service: Restaurant Staff (aside from Phil's) were all great! Casino staff were friendly and efficient with bringing drinks. Front Desk was friendly.<br/><br/>Overall, I would certainly recommend staying at TI!	5	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

I booked a room on Cyber Monday and received an excelellent deal, I booked us a room in the Tower Suite.<br/><br/>We loved pretty much everything about this hotel and casino.<br/><br/>Our Room:<br/>We stayed in room 19-050. The doors to the room are French doors and very nice looking. The room was very big, nice view of strip and Pallazo. We had two bathrooms, one with a shower and one with a jacuzzi tub. Each bathroom had a closet. The bathrooms were a nice size, the one with the jacuzzi was a very very large bathroom. Clean room, comfortable bed, lots of space, had a mini fridge, not too far of a walk from lobby to the room. Pretty fireworks at night right out window from Sirens show.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The scale in the bathroom had a broken plastic screen and looked really old, like it needed to be thrown away, lol. The lighting in the room was pretty dim even with them all on. People wanting to go to sleep early might hear the Sirens show thats last show is at 10pm. And the $20 a day resort fee is stupid.....<br/>Not huge issues at all, but I like to write everything in my reviews. <br/><br/>Casino:<br/>Really liked this casino! Lots of fun slot machines, never had to wait to long for a drink, not too far of a walk to get anywhere. I did get confused a lot about where I was in the casino. I would think I was in one spot when really I would be on the other side, nothing bad, just the way it is laid out. <br/><br/>Food: <br/>The buffet at TI is really really good!!! We ate here twice because it was really fresh, and really good! The dessert area is really fun too because they have lots of little fresh made mini donuts, ice cream, cakes, and even someone making cotton candy. And for $4 you can get unlimited champagne up til I think 4pm. We also ate at The Coffee Shop for breakfast our first day there because there wasn't a lot open for food at 8:30am. It was good food, a little bit overpriced, but I noticed that most of the restaurants and drinks are overpriced in Vegas. I heard Canters restaurant has really good Reubans, and they looked amazing, but we did not get a chance to eat there. Loved all of the different restaurants available to choose from.<br/><br/>We would definitely recommend staying here. I would have liked it a little more if it had easier access to other hotels, but that's not a huge problem. They do have a free tram that goes back and forth to the Mirage. And you can go across the street over the sky bridge to Venitian. It was just at night when I was walking around playing slots really late it would have been nice to go to another casino that you could just easily walk right over to. <br/><br/>	5	3	-1	4	4	4	-1	-1

Lots to do in Vegas (Clubs Haven, Shows, Restuarants, Casinos, etc,), But this property lacks alot of things that other Hotels can offer. Restuarants, well let's just say that there are only 2 that are worth even mentioning. Stake House (OK), and a Mexican Restuarant (Very Good). Other then that it has nothing to offer, espiecially if your a young person.<br/><br/>No outside sitting area to have your coffee in the morning, no real clubs, no real excitements, just very plain.

There are a lot of great things about this hotel ?I have been there three times and plan on going back again next time.,<br/><br/>For one, it is in a perfect spot. Right in the middle of the strip and walking distance to the bulk of the other strip hotels. Secondly, it is very nice inside. The rooms are remodeled recently and much nicer than I expected. They are not terribly large, but they are clean, the beds are very comfortable, and the bathrooms are spotless (on my three visits) with nice toiletries.<br/><br/>I also like the casino and the bars within. To me it is not impossible to navigate, once you walk through it a few times. It is easy to find a door to get out or find the elevators. The casino floor is not pretentious at all ?everyone is there to have fun. Gilley's Saloon is also a nice change of pace from the typical &quot;club&quot; type lounges and bars in other hotels. The staff at checking was extremely friendly and got me in quickly, even asking which floor/room I wanted and giving it to me without hesitation.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call TI a powerhouse for restaurant quality by any means, however, you are literally 10-15 minutes walking distance from some outstanding places (Palazzo, Venetian, Mirage, Caesar's, Bellagio, Paris), so it doesn't really matter in my opinion.<br/><br/>The price is really the kicker. It is not really expensive at all for everything that you are getting. A great location (this is big is you have never been to vegas), excellent rooms, friendly service, and a fun casino at one of the cheapest prices on the strip. I have been to a bunch of places, from low end (Imperial palace, Excalibur) to high end (Bellagio, Aria) and I always find myself selecting TI for the great combination of price/convenience/quality.	5	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	4

Booked this on hotwire for a pretty great price. This resort definitely had the best bars of anywhere on the strip. Great food and drinks at both Gilleys and Kahunaville. Both were very reasonably priced for Vegas. Great view of the strip, you can actually see the mirage's volcano show perfectly from looking out the window. Very good bed and pillows. <br/><br/>A few minor flaws like subpar towels, and shampoos/conditioner but nothing big. The room not having a microwave is pretty odd, a lot of dive motels even offer one of those. Also the service at the coffee shop was god awful, I would reccomend avoiding that restaurant.<br/><br/>Overall I would gladly stay there again. If you consider yourself a party person, then its a must stay because they had two of the best bars in Vegas and both were without cover charges.	5	5	-1	3	4	3	-1	5

No tip, and that's rare for me. Had 2 free buffets and we found the buffet to be very lacking in variety and quality. Very chewy ribs and the selections were not great. Great desserts though. Would not pay the $28 for the Dinner buffet, not a chance. Didn't get to try the pool as it was closed. Pirate show was also shut down but have seen it a number of times so wasn't a big deal.

The location is great for staying on the strip and a pretty average price with that. Basic king room, everything was very clean except for the carpet. Pretty gross but as long as you don't touch it with your bare feet, you will be alright! I did find that the drinks come really fast when you are playing slots which is what you want when you are gambling. It was penny slots, not a big deal! I did have to turn the cocktail server away a couple of times as I hadn't finished the previous drink. I wouldn't recommend the food there, just check out some of the other restaurants on the strip.

The first for two nights and the second, eleven days later for three to bracket a trip to Palm Desert. Our first stay went well. The room, the check-in, etc . The second should have been even better as we were offered an upgrade to a room with a panoramic view. And the view was wonderful but the room was an odd shape and not quite as comfortable...in fact, the bed was decidedly warped with a big bump in the middle. We should have complained but did not because the view was spectacular and everything else was fine.<br/>One caution...if you are looking for a rest forget it ! The booming of hourly volcanos and the competing show at the Venetian were really loud. In fact, the room shook . But, the parking is easy, the room has a fridge, the bathroom is lovely and the staff were all good.<br/>The fitness centre is better than most with excellent equipment. We found that the buffet was better at lunch than at supper and I would caution against the sushi. It looked tired however the Asian station was quite good and dished up soups to order. Salads are also custom made and excellent, the dessert station is super with gorgeous macaroons dipped in dark chocolate.The two chefs at this station really were proud of their work and rightly so. Kids were also enjoying cotton candy...but we resisted !<br/>Overall I would say it is a good choice if you want to be on the strip. This hotel is no longer part of the MGM brand and they are trying harder. Young visitors and families seemed happy enough...seniors maybe not so much.<br/>Incidentally...The Deli is very good and good value. Soups were enormous. I haven't fifgured out the peculiar modern (?) decor or the weird booth benches but the food is absolutely traditional. Head for a table instead. And Starbucks is pricey too...better go out to get your java fix.	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	2

Check-in took 40 minutes (I timed it) which was a bad start, and front desk staff were non-friendly and mechanical, but efficient. We were on the 14th floor, 2 rooms facing the strip which was nice and one room facing the back which didn't have a good view, but definitely quieter. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Fridges in the rooms were handy. Walgreens is directly across the street to pick up necessities or get alcohol to keep in your room. Across the street at Casino Royale you can get 99 cent beer and Margaritas. We went to a lot of the free shows at each of the hotels. None are really spectacular, (except the Bellagio fountains) but fun to see. We saw La Reve, Legends and &quot;O&quot; Cirque du Soliel. &quot;O&quot; and La Reve are similar (water-themed) shows, but we definitely recommend La Reve. It costs less and the seating is way better. We didn't have great seats for &quot;O&quot;, and felt like we wasted our money. Also, our hotel said it was sold out but we went directly to the Bellagio and found lots of seats available. The Legends show was just o.k. We took one day and drove to Zion Park in Utah for hiking which was absolutely beautiful. We went to two buffets--Harrah's &amp; TI. The one at Harrahs had a lot more seafood and the service was excellent. If you are going to have wine, buy a bottle instead of glasses, it's cheaper. The buffet at Treasure Island was fresher, the chefs were friendly, but there were many, many empty tables and yet they made people wait and stand in line for a long time. We had a hard time enjoying our meal and relaxing having all these people standing, watching, waiting for us to leave. We were NOT impressed by that. We recommend an Italian restaurant slightly off the strip called Batista's. Great atmosphere, good food, and bottomless wine. For Mexican food, go to Ricardos (off the strip) Excellent food, &amp; service. Freemont street is worth seeing. We also went on the rides at the Stratosphere--again an experience but a little pricey for very short ride times. Yes, it's true, we chose not to gamble, spent our money instead on excellent food, great shopping, entertainment, good drinks at lounges and bars (check out the minus 5 bar at Mandalay Bay) and gifts for the kids who stayed home this trip : ) Treasure Island is a decent hotel, great location, but we would NOT stay here again because of the unfriendly service and the resort fee which is a rip off.	3	5	-1	5	5	1	-1	5

The carpets were greasy and satined and when it came time to go to bed, there were used &quot;items&quot; in the bed! It took an.hour to get housekeeping there to change the bedding. The next day, we went to the front desk and were promised a &quot;deep cleaning&quot; would be.done right away (to remove what looked like mold in the shower) only to.come back to our room 5 hours later and find they hadn't touched the.room at all. Calling the front desk, they offered to move us to another room (which was half the size with one bed and a roll away). They then.later.found us another room with double beds...but that was after they made us late for the wedding festivities. Upon checkout (we were going to stay three says, but moved to the Mirage for the last night) and when.we.demanded.to.see the Manager...we were offered the waiving of the resort fee (which they were never supposed to.charge anyway as part of the wedding group) DISGUSTING, UNCLEAN HOTEL!!

We found the staff friendly and the hotel suitable for our needs. We chose not to eat in the hotel so I cannot comment on the restaurant. We had rooms at the end of a corridor so we had a wonderful view of the mountains and The Strip, ideal. We were above the Pirate Ship experience but we weren't in our room when it was happening.<br/>The casino was small but it was enough for our needs, We both felt it was good value as a base. Opposite The Venetian for shopping and dining and also across the bridge to Walgreens for every day needs. Our rooms were enormous and very clean. Lovely toiletries. I didn't object to service charge as some hotels charge more than that just for internet access.<br/>They always seem to have special rates so it is worth booking direct with hotel.<br/>Don't miss the Bellagio fountains, eat the Paris resort and sit on the patio part of the restaurant for the best view. Lovely breakfasts at this restaurant too.	4	4	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

The rooms are decent and have updated decor, but could use a much better cleaning as there were some stains on the walls and build-up on the furniture around the handles. Beds were comfy and clean, but the towels had a weird smell, almost like they were burnt with bleach. <br/><br/>It would have been nice to know in advance that this casino was smoking, and the casino is open to the restaurants, so the smoke smell is there when eating. The buffet is a good deal for eating if you get the two for one coupon, but not really worth $30 for dinner without the coupon. <br/><br/>It is very centrally located on the strip which is nice and was a great deal for the price. It is right near the Fashion Show Mall, a Wallgreens, and a Starbucks.<br/><br/>I did not use the pool (as it was closed for winter) or the fitness or spa facilites. <br/><br/>Overall the pluses outweighed the minuses and this is a great affordable hotel on the strip.	5	5	-1	3	2	3	-1	4

We shared the holiday with my brother, my sister in law my nephew and his girlfriend. We found the hotel very nice. the staff were very kind and helpful. We stayed in the tower suite, very spacious and enjoyable. The size of the room was lovely to come back to after a full day of walking. One draw back to the room is it was quite dark even with all the lights on. The hotel had quite a variety of restaurants to choose from. We just found the portions were too large and the food had too much sodium in it. Overall we enjoyed our stay at Tresure Island and would stay there again.The location is handy and the size of the hotel isn't huge so it was easy to find your way around.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

I received a great rate for a strip view room but likely would have chosen a more luxurious property if the rate wouldn't have been so competitive. While the daily resort charges at any hotel bother me, TI's at least included some 2 for 1 passes on buffets and drinks that made the cost justified, including access to the fitness center and internet.	5	5	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

Once you become accustomed to it you notice that there aren't any of the grand overriding themes that some of the other hotels have which is slightly disappointing.<br/><br/>However, once you escape the smoke (that is in probably every Vegas casino) and head up to your room it is very very nice. Quiet and clean. Situated near the top of the Strip however close to everything. Pho (Vietnamese restaurant downstairs) was alright, not great service, reasonable food. Had a Paradise Platter from Kahunaville which was worth it (shared amongst 4 people along with a Groupon cocktail deal).<br/><br/>Basically, the hotel is above average and well maintained, the casino isn't the most interesting, but it's all very close to where you want to be. Also, was told that the Resort Fee doesn't apply if you book through an overseas agent.	4	4	-1	4	4	2	-1	4

I would have preferred another hotel but found that I had no major complaints with TI. TI is value priced a pretty good location. There are more luxurious, higher nightly rate hotels. <br/><br/>We arrived early morning. As we expected, the rooms were not ready so we checked our bags and grabbed a bite to eat. When we returned to the front desk, our rooms were ready. This was very much appreciated. <br/><br/>The casino area is older but the guest halls and rooms are updated, modern, and comfortable. Bed was very comfortable. Linens were fine. Rooms have a fridge and safe in the closet. Maid service was excellent. <br/><br/>Probably due to the ??alue?price, there were quite a few ?0 something?party groups over the weekend. <br/><br/>Restaurants choices are limited. There are other properties that offer additional dining options within a short walk of TI. For TI restaurants, Phil?? Steakhouse was very good, excellent service. Had a pretty good sandwich at Kahunaville (breakfast was also good). The Coffee Shop has a better breakfast selection. As for Gilley????aybe OK as a bar but, the food we ordered was absolutely awful (worse than any restaurant I have ever been to)! There were three of us, each ordered a different entree and all were bad. Manager did offer apology and free drinks. I would never return. <br/><br/>The resort fee is $20 and provides internet access, fitness center, 2-for 1 cocktail and buffet vouchers (one of each voucher per room), and a few more ??eatures? Several of the hotels in LV charge fees but they should be ??ore upfront?during the booking process. This type of ??ee?can also be found at other US resorts. <br/><br/>I did have a few issues with internet connection but this was handled promptly when I called the front desk. <br/><br/>Location - Free tram to Mirage, Sky Bridge to the Venetian, next door to the Fashion Show Mall. Walk to Harrah?? to catch the monorail. The Palazzo is across the street. There is also Walgreens just across the street. Two Starbucks (one inside TI and the other is just a short walk, near the entrance and this one is open 24 hrs).	4	4	-1	4	3	4	-1	5

I thought, &quot;Has it gone downhill since I was there?&quot; It hasn't. TI is as great as it ever was. Is it the most luxurious hotel in Vegas? No, but then this is the town of extravagance. In any other city, this would be a four or five-star hotel. The rooms are large, clean, and super comfy! Our bed was HUGE, and we slept like babies on it. If you want a hotel with a really strong theme with lots of kitsch, this isn't it, but we liked that about TI. It's just a nice hotel/casino, and the dealers in the casino here are the most friendly in town. There were happy to explain rules to you and even give you suggestions as to what would be the most strategic move to make. The buffet is very good, and with Expedia, we got two buffets each free, which was great. Some folks complain about the resort fee (which, in January 2012, was $20 a day), but I didn't mind paying this because, with it, we got some meal vouchers, drink vouchers, free newspapers, free printing, and free internet, which we thought was worth it.

If you are paying cash (which I did the first couple of times), they also have some fantastic deals on their petite suites with two bathrooms. The rooms are nicely decorated, and the only real problem is the public area- the ceiling is low and the fixtures are fairly old, and that results in it not feeling as nice as some other hotels. The food outlets are good places to get something to eat, but not good places if your goal is to dine. The spa, on the other hand, is incredibly nice and worth visiting. It is certainly a hotel I would stay at again regardless of whether I was paying or comped; whatever minor flaws it has are overcome with its great location at the middle of the strip.	5	5	-1	5	3	5	-1	5

I love TI for its staff and service, it's ease of navigation for a strip hotel--i can find my way out of this hotel, unlike the others (which is what Vegas hotels intend to do, keep you trapped inside to gamble), and for its spacious, clean, and updated rooms, good food, and decent hotel gym. I like the decor; nothing terribly remarkable, but I just know it's cleaner and nicer than Mirage or Harrah's (yuck, never stay in Harrah's). Venetian is great but big $$ and you can't find your way out. Anyway, TI will charge you for everything--Internet use, gym--but that is true for EVERY strip hotel. TI is convenient to Mirage, Ceasar's, Venetian, Wynn, and Paris and Bellagio aren't too far either. And the pirate show is fun.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Wasn't clean - glass surfaces had handprints, duvet had a tear and nailpolish spill on it. I asked for a quiet room when I made the reservation....of course, my room was within spitting distance of the ship and pirates show. It was the 1-night stay room. <br/><br/>The biggest issue I found was that the hotel really smells like cigarette smoke throughout in all areas, even the non-smoking floors. Even though they try to cover it up, it's really a problem. I was on a non-smoking floor and all the garbage cans near the elevator had stubbed cigarette burns in them--which lead me to really believe that non-smoking isn't really enforced at all. Unpacking my clothes, they also had a smell. <br/><br/>I agree with some other reviewers that the public spaces are worn looking-- especially the elevators. I mean, could some cleaning staff wipe off the pen graffiti and stickers in them and wipe them down? It would also be nice if they could put some more benches out front as well.<br/><br/>The upside at this hotel is that the staff is super, super nice. They are really great and accommodating people and many other hotels could learn from them. This is their one asset and they could really capitalize on it.<br/><br/>My last gripe would be the resort fee of $20 -- in February, the pool is closed and mainly you are creating a revenue stream for them even though it includes wireless (these costs are so minimal, so this is really gouging each guest), ability to print out boarding pass, and some free buy one, get one coupons. Well, it's Vegas, I suppose.<br/><br/>Anyway, I spent some time down at Mandalay Bay--and they'll get my business next time. No cigarette smells there and their public spaces were a bit more spruced up.	4	3	-1	2	2	5	-1	3

Found out that the swimming pool is closed for the maintanence and would not be open during our entire stay (4 days).<br/><br/>Dingy, smokey and dull casino on our way to find the guest elevetor (not enough signs to guide the guests around the floor, guess they want the maximum exposure to their casion while guests are trying find different exits, elevetors etc).<br/><br/>We were told at the check in that we could view Sirens of TI from our room (she considered this as a room upgrade...ha... ha... ha). Sure we could see some commotion and hear noise from speakers (in reality, the show that we saw from out front is awsome, only high light).<br/><br/>Room was clean and no smell of smoke (an advantage if you need non-smoking room). TV too small (a 24&quot;tv is not big enought for a room that has a king bed). NO COFFEE IN THE ROOM!!! First hotel in so many years that did not offer coffee in the room, maybe its a Vegas thing. Instead of going to starbucks in the hotel and pay double the price, walk the bridge to the fashion shaw mall, just outside the mall there is a starbucks charging regular.<br/><br/>The restaurant on site, including buffet, quality of food and service was way below par (especially ISLA the mexican joint). I expect that when I am paying an average $30 per person for the meal (drinks excluded), the quality would be better than taco bell. <br/><br/>Never used gym nor shopped at the stores within the hotel premise. Beware, the photos and the 360 tour of the hotel on TI website is misguiding and out of date. This hotel is on its downward journey.<br/><br/>Please contact me if you have any questions related to this property and I will gladly share my experience with you.	2	3	-1	3	3	2	-1	4

We got a decent price and the location was great for us. I would head over to the Wynn for lunch everyday - which is just one block over. We also did not venture past Paris except for drinks one night at the Cosmopolitan.<br/><br/>Room - felt humid and had an odd smell to me, decent sized bathroom and typical sized room. Maybe a little more modern feeling than a typical hotel room, not swanky. The view definitely made it worth it! We were on the 15th floor closer to the strip facing the Belagio, Mirage, Paris.<br/><br/>Casino - Didn't gamble much at TI's casio so I cannot really comment. We went to others out on the strip.<br/><br/>My husband and I both used the gym every day. It is nothing huge, but it had a good variety of equipment and was located near the spa, which we did not use. Each treadmill/eliptical has their own tv and all you have to bring is headphones.<br/><br/>I would stay here again, because of the price and location, but it is nothing overly spectacular. If you do not want to spend a lot of money on a hotel, but want stay in a decent room near most of the action then this may be the place for you.	4	4	-1	3	3	-1	-1	-1

Spoke to our friends who had arrived at noon, or right at check-in time, and they said they had to wait in line about an hour. I've spent a lot of time in hotels, and I can appreciate a friendly front desk agent and appreciate the entire schpeel about the property. But honestly when there are people in line behind me, I don't need you to entirely describe the spa, fitness room, how the coupon for the free breakfast works, how the internet works, etc. I appreciate the effort and understand why some people need that type of helpful walk-through, but after I had just waited in line for 30 minutes at 11pm to check-in, I really just wanted to be up in my room. Otherwise, they were very friendly and the rooms were great. Thank you!	5	5	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

Very clean, easy access to the strip, highway, shopping. Excellent restaurants. BUT there was one thing that happened that really really ticked me off. On Monday night I called the operator and asked for a corkscrew to be sent up to my room. I was transferred 3 times before I finally got room service only then to be told it would cost me $5.41 for this to be delivered to my room and it would take 30 minutes. I called the Front Desk and asked why this was the case and was told that this is what room service does. I said what if I wanted soap or shampoo would I be charged this fee and they said no because it was a different department. UNREAL. I hope the $5.41 is worth it to TI, because I intend on telling everybody about this. The $20 resort fee is bad enough. I know every hotel in Vegas does this. I'm there 4 times a year. I get it. But I don't get why a fee of $5.41 would be charged for a simple delivery such as a corkscrew. HORRIBLE!!!!	4	5	-1	4	5	1	-1	4

There weren't a lot of options available to us, so we chose TI based on it's location next to the hotels we'd have rather stayed at.<br/><br/>It is affordable, and that's important for a lot of people. In fact, for the neighborhood, it's very affordable. We paid next to nothing for our hotel rooms even for New Year's week. <br/><br/>It's a perfect size hotel. It's not too large like some of the new super casinos, but it's large enough to provide guests with most of what they need. We had some good chats with a lot of the dealers and wait-staff on the casino floor. We encountered only one rude employee with the hundred or so we spoke with during our trip.<br/><br/>The casino at TI is much smokier than in other hotel casinos. And even the hallways on the smoke free floor smelled of smoke. Our allergies were kicking! And the decor is dated, but hey, that's why it's cheap.<br/><br/>Check in and check out were a breeze, which was a nice surprise considering it was a holiday week. They opened check-in at 10am instead of noon, which was great for us since we came in on an early flight. We expected to store our luggage and wait, but our rooms were ready at 10. <br/><br/>The mexican restaurant is delicious! We ate there two nights in a row. I highly recommend it.	5	5	-1	3	3	4	-1	4

My son decided to get married in Vegas (Dec. 2009) &amp; picked this hotel strictly because they liked the look of the pool &amp; the pirate ship show. Pool &amp; show closed for maintenance - could this not have been mentioned at the time of booking, after all this was their honeymoon as well. My son was livid, complained &amp; we were told we could go to the Trump Hotel to swim (quite a trek). Not quite sure what the resort fee was for - assumed it was for pool/show. We won't go back even though staff throughout were great. This was to be a special weekend to remember - we definitly will remember all right! At least there was coffee in the room back then........	3	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

It seams that every Thursday, Friday and Saturday the Restaurant that is located by the pool, Kahunaville throws a party in the afternoon. Great crowd, Great Vibe. and it's free to get in. I have been to all of the other wild Vegas pool parties and loved them. These guys seam to have done the same and brought a real friendly pool party to Treasure Island and Kahunaville. If you are there on those days. GO!	5	5	-1	5	4	5	-1	4

However, a few weeks before our trip we got a terrific comp from TI for 2 nights free and they were the 2 most expensive nights we were going to be there. Add $110 of free slot play and &quot;Bob's Your Uncle&quot;! We switched our reservations.<br/><br/>Now, the other two times we had stayed in suites and this time we decided to stay in a regular room.<br/><br/>Check in: It was quick. We were invited guests and there was no one in line. However, we did arrive at about 7:30 pm and because we were late and because the hotel was all booked we did not get the room we had booked! We had booked a king room and were given a room with two queens and the promise of a nice king the next day. We weren't exactly happy but not all that surprised due to the lateness of our flight in to LV.<br/><br/>Room: The first room was fine. Two queens, it was clean but no view at all except for a blank wall. We really had been put in one of the last rooms they had. But, we didn't spend much time in it as we showered and was down in the casino ASAP.<br/><br/>The second room was spot on. We were able to change rooms before noon the next day and it was perfect. It was clean, well maintained, nice bathroom with a tub I could actually soak in. The bed was comfortable as always and there was plenty of room. What I loved about this room was that it was on the corner and we had two window views. One was towards the Venitian and Plazio and the other was towards the Wynn and Encore and overlooked the pirate show. Because of the two windows, we got a lot of lovely natural sunlight in the room with the beautiful views. However, the room isn't exactly quiet as you WILL hear the pirate show and some of the louder traffic on the strip. I wasn't bothered by it at all. The room number was 27037. I will definitely ask for the this room again!<br/><br/>Also, ALL rooms now have a fridge and a laptop size safe. There was plenty of storage space and a good size bathroom.<br/><br/>Food: We ate at the buffet twice for breakfast and were happy with the selections. The omlette station was great and the variety was nice. We had no complaints. Our favourite quick grab was at the Canter Deli. This became our late night snack of a reuben sandwich with fries and a drink. One sandwich was HUGE and we share it and was plenty full. It was something like $15 and was good value. We would take it to go, ask for plates and have it in the room.<br/><br/>Casino: The slots paid out better than we EVER have had TI slots pay out before. There were a few days that we just went from one slot to another putting in $20 and taking out $250 to $500 each time! We had a great time and in the end got a 3rd night comped! The drinks were a bit hit or miss. I never went without a drink when I really wanted one. However, on some occassions we couldn't drink our drinks fast enough before the waitress was around again! A few got to know us and know our drinks and would actually have them on the tray when they came around to take orders. We didn't have to wait! We did our normal tipping of $1 per drink.<br/><br/>Check out: Quick and only took seconds!<br/><br/>Overall, we were very pleased with TI yet again and really couldn't complain about anything. We would recommend it!	5	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

The pricing was reasonable even with the resort fee. I had booked a deluxe room, non smoking with king bed. My husband and I arrived Monday around 1pm, only a few people ahead of us to check in so it was rather quick. I had heard about the $20 trick and decided to try it...it worked. We got upgraded to a larger corner room with panoramic view of the strip and free bottle of champagne (I tried for the petite suite but they were all booked due to Valentine's Day). The room was spacious, clean and nicely furnished (see my pics). Comfy bed, extra pillows with good linens. Bathroom was a nice size, deep tub and good shower pressure. Unfortunately there was no fan in our bathroom so all could be heard in the bedroom area. Also, no coffee machine in the room but there is a fridge. You can pick up some snacks/drinks at the Walgreens across the street (Venetian). Housekeeping was excellent. Our room overlooked the pirate show which runs at 5:30, 7, 8:30 and 10 pm...don't have a nap at these times. <br/>We tried the buffet for lunch, two for one pricing with coupon, about $20...food was tasty with a good selection. We also had midnight snack at the cafe, cheese omelet and a burger, both very good selections. <br/>Awesome show by Cirque du Soleil - Mystere. Valentine's Day they offered a 35% discount so we paid $150ish for two tickets. <br/>Overall, we were very satisfied with our stay here and will definitely stay again.	5	4	-1	4	5	4	-1	4

If you are looking for a quiet get away or a fun filled week it is all here. All the staff we encountered were friendly,polite and yet very professional. The beds were wonderfully comfortable and the view we had from the 31st floor at the back of the hotel was awesome with the mountains and the city lights. We were only back a couple days and already talking about wanting to go back again. Thank you for an incredible week !!	4	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

The hotel room was large and modernly furnished. The amenities provided in the bathroom were from the hotel's oleksandra spa and smelt wonderful. <br/><br/>The hotel has a resort fee but this entitles you to be in the VIP section at the Sirens of TI show, 2 for 1 buffet vouchers, gym usage and 2 for 1 cocktails and access to wifi.<br/><br/>The Vietnamese cafe had very authentic Vietnamese food and had very good service. The hotel's buffet was a little bit disappointing as the food didn't taste fantastic. They have a own personal make your own salad chef and really cute desert counter.<br/><br/>Good connections to the Fashion Mall and the hotel is located across from the Venetian and Palazzo. It is easily connected via the walkways (Good 5-10min walk). <br/><br/>Overall, lovely location at the upper end of the strip!	4	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Of I wasn't able to get the killer rates I found online I probably wouldn't have stayed here. I wont come back unless I find cheap rates again. <br/><br/>The resort fee is a complete joke. The only thing worth anything is the bogo free buffet.<br/><br/>The room was clean and looked just like it did online. Bed was pretty comfortable and the bath room was spacious. However, the tv was tiny. We considered getting a movie in our room but the tv was too small to see any detail. <br/><br/>The location was great. We walked to all the shows and restaurants we wanted to go to. <br/><br/>All in all, unless you can find great rates ($60) a night, include the weekend, I wouldn't call in much of a value.	3	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	-1

Needless to say I have stayed at many of the different hotels &amp; Treasure Island is one of my favorites. The rooms are average size but clean &amp; very comfortable. I find it very easy to sleep in their beds because they are so comfortable. I also enjoy that each bed has 4 pillows of different variety to choose from. The room comes with a mini fridge which is rare in Vegas. The bathrooms are large &amp; have large tubs. We had a room on the 14th floor with great views of the strip &amp; pirate show. The casino is nice sized &amp; offers a nice variety. The only con to this hotel I would say is the location. It is on the north end of the strip not centrally located however the positive to this was it is quiet. It's nice if your looking to escape some of the larger crowds.	4	3	-1	5	5	4	-1	-1

The treasue Island is in a great location at a very reasonable price.<br/>It is directly across from the Venetioan and Palazzo and an easy walk to Bellagio, Ceasers etc.<br/>The staff was very courteous. Ask for a higher level room to check out the great views.<br/>The only complaint I have along with every one else is the $20.00 daily resort fee. Especially when the pool is closed for the season. Most people dont come to use the gym or get a newspaper, would much rather have had spent the same $20.00 in their casino.<br/>The buffet was just ok.<br/>There is a great bar &quot;Gilleys&quot; on site with a mechanical bull that I could have just sat there for hours and watched people,,was hilarious.<br/>Also a Stabucks if you want.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Beds were comfortable, hotel clean - Only complaint was the check in line was the longest I've ever waited in. It seemed like we waited well over 1/2 hour to check in.

The casino is smelly/dirty and understaffed not to mention lacking good gambling action and flow. The rooms are average, the service is not inspiring.

The room is small but nice for the price of the 4 star hotel in LV strip. Sign up for free menbership of the TI club to get better deal than online other websites. They do charge a $20 resort fee per night which including newspaper and in room internet(wifi) services. If you like Chinese/ vietnamese food. there is one special restaurant inside the casino or you want to drive about 1 mile to China town on Spring mountain street right next to the hotel across from freeway 15. The buffet in the hotel is just ok for the price if they give you buy one get one free. Regular price is not worth it...	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	3

For the rate, the room was fine and the location on the Strip is great. We had spa treatments scheduled for Saturday. The spa is small and seems like it would be crowded, without much lounging area, if there were a lot of people, but it was pretty empty when we were there. I had an 80-minute Ayurvedic massage, which was amazing. We had the Saturday champage buffet brunch. The food was not as good and the selection was not as wide as many brunch buffets I have tried, but it seemed clean, the champagne was included and it was only $24.95, so overall, it was ok. A few negatives - after we got to the room, we noticed there was no alarm clock. We called and housekeeping brought one, but it was a very basic alarm clock - I'm used to nice resorts offering a model that at least lets you plug in and play an Ipod. On the second day, housekeeping only half made up our room. Beds were made, but the trash was not taken out and the towels were not replaced. We called three times over a 90-minute period but still no towels. At check-in, we got a buy-one-get-one-free coupon for a free beer or cocktail that could be used at one of several restaurants, but when we tried to use it on Saturday afternoon, we were told it was not applicable during happy hour prices. Since the paid drink and the free drink both would be discounted, I'm not sure why we couldn't use it. Better than some places I've stayed on the Strip (i.e. Monte Carlo) not as good as others (Palazzo, Aria) but ok if you get a good rate.	4	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

Fine if you're under 25 and looking to party all night long! Thankfully we had booked the Treasure Island hotel for the second half of our stay in Vegas.<br/><br/>Walking around the Treasure Island hotel was a way more relaxed experience than before at the Mirage. Yeah, maybe a bit cheesier, but calmer and way more fun. The restaurants were awesome and our room was excellent. Big, clean with an outstanding view of the strip!<br/><br/>We could say more. However, Vegas has many hotels each offering its own experience. Treasure Island was what worked for us. In fact, we're booked to return this spring and hit up the slots!!	4	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

When we first went to Las Vegas we wondered where to stay as there were so many places to choose from. Some were out of our budget and some out of our style. Our local travel agency told us they always recommend TI because of it's location.Shortly after my wife was at the doctors office and our future trip to Las Vegas came up in the conversation. He remarked that he had been to Vegas several times and just loved to stay at Treasure Island. We thought if he was satisfied we probably would be also. It fit our budget so took a chance. We were totally satisfied and now have returned twice more. Treasure Island is in an exellent location on the strip. It is walking distance to a large amount of places such as the Fashion Mall,Denneys,Casino Royale,The Wynn ,The Venetion and Ceasar's Palace. The Mirage is close by and because of an upgrade on our room (free of charge) we were able to watch the eruption of the volcano from our room each night.They have one of the best free shows in what they call The Sirens of TI. A new feature is Mickey Gilley's bar where every night the place was hopping to the best of country music. TI is very quiet and relaxing and are known for the most comfortable beds in town, Right beside the hotel is where you catch shuttles and busses for any tours as well as the Duece bus which stops on both sides of the strip for your convenience.

The Starbucks located directly out front on LV Blvd was a huge bonus each morning for a quick bite and coffee.Rooms were functional and comfortable.

My room- the basic deluxe, no view- was not a 4 star room. I'd give it 3.5 at best. Towels weren't fluffy and kind of smelled musty. The room was fairly modern, but nothing special. TV was small as others have mentioned. Minimal toiletries. I was not impressed with maid service at all... I tipped the first day hoping to come back to a perfect room, but I was not impressed, and I did not tip again. <br/><br/>Used the gym twice- but it's very busy in the morning between 8-9 and I was lucky to get a piece of cardio equipment both times. Gym was nice, though. Good equipment, free fruit and water. <br/><br/>The casino is nice. Just the right size. Decent selection of games and restaurants. Clean. Best location- easy access to Fashion Show mall or Strip. <br/><br/>Overall, for the price it was acceptable, but I don't intend to stay here again.	4	5	-1	3	3	3	-1	-1

The hotel has changed quite a bit since my last stay. The service this time around was pretty poor. I actually had to leave the checkout line because it was moving so slow and I had to catch a flight. The mattress in my room was in awful shape. The room and bathroom were both clean. The hotel is in need of a makeover. The hotel is getting tired and needs a renovation. <br/><br/>The rate was great and it was the most appealing part of my stay.

Would I ever stay here again, probably not, because there were a few issues that I find annoying for a 4 star hotel. Number one is as many have mentioned the resort fee of $24.00. I know many of the 4 star hotels charge this, however, this is a bit execessive for this hotel. Also, the shower head and faucet divertor was bad, thus the shower was not acceptable, as I like a nice hard shower. The casino is a bit dated and of course smoke filled which drives me nuts when my clothes smell like cigarettes. Most 4 star hotels have a better ventilation system such as the Mandalay Bay, Venetian or Paris which I had wished I stayed at. I also would have liked to have a coffee maker in the room as I had to go downstairs to get a cup of coffee. The good was the rooms were not so bad and met my expectations. Nice bed linens and the bed was comfortable and I have a bad back. Nice walk to the Mirage or where I was most of the time at The Venetian across the street. My take is if you can afford it go across the street to the Venetian. Very nice and great restaurants	2	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

It was clean and comfortable, and the beds were AMAZING. The check in was quick and efficient, and I couldn't have asked for more from the hotel staff. My only complaint was that the water pressure in the shower wasn't great, and therefore it was more difficult to was my hair! Aside from that, the hotel was quiet (on the hotel room floors), and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I would definitely stay here again! <br/><br/>I must say, another great thing about TI is that the hotel doesn't feel as massive as it is. Unlike the MGM Grand and other hotels on the strip, we didn't have to go through the massive casino to get to our rooms, and I appreciated that!<br/><br/>Due to the above reasons, TI's value for the cost, and it's amazing location on the strip, I would recommend this hotel to anyone that asks.	5	5	-1	4	5	5	-1	5

The hotel was clean and rooms were comfortable and large enough with a soaking tub. Bed and pillows were top notch. Downside is the casino with low ceilings and a pretty smokey atmosphere.<br/><br/>Check in was a breeze and we received daily complimentary paper. Don't waste your money on the coffee at the Breezes bar. Pretty expensive and Starbucks is just around the corner and much, much better. Resort fee provides 2 for 1 buffet on certain nights. This is a good deal, but we found when that wasn't offered, there was much less on the buffet and the quality went down hill. Pretty pricey without the discount and worth your time to go elsewhere.<br/><br/>Coffee shop provides decent breakfast but the wait staff is pretty slow, even when they are not busy.<br/><br/>Easily checked out from our room with no problem getting a cab quickly back to the airport.	3	4	-1	4	3	3	-1	5

I took my wife for her birthday to his show on the 18th of February, only Vegas show he has done in 10 years in which he stated as well. After several songs he told everyone about his fall a while back requiring him to sit for most of his concert, of course my wife and I and I?? sure most if not everyone watching and listening understood. Mr. Gilley both my wife and I hope a fast and 100% recovery to you sir. What made me rate the show and hotel as terrible was the fact the ushers, security and other support personnel allowed people in the audience to illegally video and audio tape the show. They claim such great security, cameras etc.. well check them. My wife and I were in row H section 100. We both complained, to the ushers and security twice who said the ushers were in charge. Neither did anything, we were so upset that I told the security officer, that he and the security in general are lame [--] security that did nothing, his response was well the ushers are in charge . The one usher that seated us earlier gave us the wrong seats, and laughing at us complaining, we chalked it up to him feeling worthless for himself and low self esteem. Gets better one of the show tapers was so foul mouthed talking loud, in between of course her taping like several others were doing like walking up to the stage for better pirating of course. Sad that nobody including Mickey Gilley?? people cared. Tickets clearly stated the above. People seated next to us left half way through the show because of the pirating, distracting allowed. Anyone wanting to know more detail I allow to be contacted through Trip Advisor.	1	4	-1	-1	1	1	-1	-1

We stayed from 2/17 to 2/20 in 10-100 and based on our experience, we won?? stay again. <br/><br/>First, upon checking in we were told we had to pay a $22.00 daily resort fee, and this was the first time we were hearing about this. When we asked what we received for paying this fee we were told we got to use the fitness center (which we never used), the business computer to print off boarding passes (which we never used), and something else that I can?? even remember now because we either didn?? use it, or it was so crappy it wasn?? worth remembering. So to break it down we spent $66.00 dollars for nothing. Then come to find out there are hotels on the strip that don?? charge resort fees. Not to mention I would never use the word resort to describe Treasure Island. Also, we weren?? advised where we were to go to obtain information about places to eat or nice places to shop etc. My boyfriend has been to Vegas a couple of times and he said when he?? stayed at other hotels the front desk representatives were very helpful in directing them to the concierge and giving ideas on fun things to do while staying there. <br/><br/>Second, our room was far below standards. When we walked into our room I noticed the dingiest towel I had ever seen in a hotel hanging up in our bathroom and a disgusting wad of hair under the sink in the corner. Our room also had scribbling on the wall next to the door. Additionally we found a couple holes in our sheets. On Saturday, our room was not cleaned even though we left the room around 11:30am and we made sure the privacy sign was not on the door, nothing of ours was on the bed, and our dirty towels were in a pile on the floor. None of this is acceptable, but if it had just been one thing it would be easier to let it go than a whole slew of items missed by housekeeping. <br/><br/>Third, you can hear everything the people next to you or in the hallway say; and since this is Vegas, people are constantly up. <br/><br/>Fourth, the channels at the Treasure Island were on par with basic TV with the TBS channel thrown in, but I would never classify that as cable TV. <br/><br/>Fifth, the tram to the Mirage was not in service. <br/><br/>Finally, we found it hard to gamble at the casino hear as they never had a $5 craps table (excluding in the early morning). We actually walked somewhere else to do most of our gambling because of this reason. We spent enough money at other hotel casinos that they were offering us rooms (which we would have taken had we not paid for Treasure Island in advance). <br/><br/>All in all, this is the most disappointing hotel I??e ever stayed at and I won?? recommend it to anyone.&quot;<br/><br/>- I paid around $110 a night. And found out that the location is just as great as the Wynn, Aria, Bellagio, Ceasar's Palace, Harrah's or any of those. The Wynn was even comprable price wise and 100 times nicer. The only locations that suck are places like the Stratosphere, Rio (although they have the best buffet), Trump Towers, LVH, and Palms.	1	4	-1	2	1	2	-1	2

I have stayed in the Mandalay Bay and thou its nice it's too far away. I did the MGM and it has a half star more then the TI, but the rooms are not half as nice and the place is far too big. I stayed off the strip and I did not have the same Vegas experience. I stayed at the Flamingo and it was ok, but the TI is nicer for the same price. <br/>I love the Venetian, but I have to say I'd rather spend my money on shopping and dinning then staying at the Venetian. I can get a room at the TI with a view of the Venetian Grand Canal from my less expensive the the Venetian. <br/>So we came back to the TI for the second time last December ( and yes we do Vegas a lot:))<br/>This time we got upgraded to the 22nd floor, and let me say what a view, I think only a helicopter could top that:) <br/>The rooms are very modern and comfortable, I admit the Hotel and Casino is staring to get a little dated, but it looks like they were doing a lot of renovations the last 2 months.<br/>I'm not a gambler, so for me the TI is just a great place at a awesome location. It is connected to the Mirage by a short train, it's between fashion mall and Caesar's palace. There is also two convenient Tickets 4 tonight locations nearby. <br/>And what I really appreciate is that it takes me 5 min to get from my room to the very Heart of the strip. Some of the other places I stayed at it would take me 20 minutes to do that, or more if I got lost in the process.<br/>The buffet at the TI is not really my thing, but the Steakhouse is good. The nightlife is ok, but the Mirage next door is easy to get to, and has lots of fun places to go at night.<br/>TI I will be back again:)	4	5	-1	5	4	3	-1	5

We asked for a quiet room and he had no problem accommodating us. We heard some noise one night but not the endless slamming doors (due to poor door returns) we've experienced at other hotels. This, even though we were across from the service elevator. All in all, I give it a 5 for quietness.<br/><br/>The room was nothing fancy but absolutely adequate. Although the pillow-top mattresses were nice, they did sag a bit and the pillows (not down) were way too plump. The room seemed to be clean. The bathroom was spacious although the two BIG problems were that the water smelled like sulfur and the shower head/pressure was terrible. Good luck rinsing if you've got thick hair.<br/><br/>There was no coffee pot but that seems to be par for the course in Vegas hotels. $8 at Wal-mart solved that problem and saved us from $10 morning coffee at Starbuck's. There is a safe and... unlike some rooms we've stayed at in the past, a micro fridge which was a really nice amenity. My biggest complaint with the room was not enough outlets. I had no choice but to sit at the desk if I wanted to use my laptop.<br/>The exorbitant resort fee included wi-fi but that may have been a promotion. The high fee would definitely be a factor in whether or not I return.<br/>Housekeeping did a good job each day we were there. I appreciate that security checked for room keys after a certain hour before allowing access to the elevators.<br/>The only restaurant we at was Pho's. The food was great but the service was abysmal. We tried to eat at the Coffee Shop for breakfast but after waiting ten minutes for coffee or water, we gave up. Look at my review for the Original Pancake House for what I consider to be the best place for breakfast!<br/>A nice size casino floor full of slots that won't pay you a THING! Is there an adjective more severe than TIGHT? If so, apply it here.<br/>Check out couldn't have been easier. Done through the TV and takes about a minute - brilliant idea!<br/>The location is great in that it is close to a number of other casinos and... easy access to and from the interstate. Also, the fashion mall is right across the street.<br/>All in all, a decent stay. Will I stay again? It's a coin toss.	3	5	-1	3	4	4	-1	3

Our latest trip to Vegas, we recieved a promotion and we stayed in the Petite Suite. So, this review is a comparison of those two types of rooms to provide you with the information you will need if you are trying to decide to between the two, anad/or if you are trying to decide if you should spend the extra money to move up into the Tower Suite. Both rooms that we stayed in had excellent views of the Strip and from both rooms we could watch the Sirens Show at night. Keep in mind that you are watching the show from a distance and I do not recomend this viewing if this is your first time to Vegas or seeing this show is a top priority. With the Tower Suite, we were offered a VIP seating area for Sirens and although we did not inquire about the same VIP seating with the Petite Suite, we were not offered it during check-in. Both rooms also gave us a view of the pool. From both rooms you could look out the window and see if the pool area is happening or not. Good advantage if you are into the pool scence. By a quick count, TI has 14 pool cabanas and the pool lacks both imagination and size by Vegas standards. Both rooms were located immediately after exiting the elevators. Keep in mind that you will be asked to flash your room key card to board the hotel elevators, especially on weekend nights. Now back to the rooms. The major difference between the two is size, with the Tower feeling much bigger. The beds, bedding, shower/soap, and towels are the same good quality, which is a major upgrade from their regular rooms. The restrooms (both rooms have seperate guy/girl bathrooms) are very similar. I couldn't tell any major difference here. Both rooms have a ipod/iphone docking station with the Tower having an advantage on quality over the Petite (Bose vs Memorex). The curtains/drapes in the Tower are awesome, in that they are multiple layers and will completely block the morning sun out. The drapes in the Petite do an adequate job, think Hilton quality, at this. Both rooms have a jetted whirlpool bath and both are big enough for two, with the Tower big enough for atleast three and possibly four if you don't mind touching knees. The biggest advantage of the Tower is that it comes with a mini bar and refrigerator. For us, that was a farily significant advantage. Being able to mix your own drinks in your room and have the ability to cool off some cokes was nice. Bottom line is, if you are planning on hosting a pre or post party, you should book the Tower. If you and your wife are enjoying Vegas and all that it has to offer by yourself, save your money and stay in the Petite.	4	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

We saw Cirque De Soleil which was amazing and wonderful. It was nice that it was right in our hotel and we could just go to our room afterwards.<br/><br/>The cons- VERY smokey hotel, needs better ventilation(although the rooms were not smokey, thank goodness). Ok...now on to the buffet...I read the reviews and thought well, with the deal I got, the buffet was free with the room. Even if it's not that great, at least it's free, right? WRONG! This is the worst buffet we've ever been to. The food had been sitting around was turning colors (the suishi looked like hepatitis on a plate) the &quot;salad bar&quot; was behind glass, so you had to tell the server what you wanted on your plate. we actually left hungry...if we'd paid the price, I believe was around $24, we would have been mad.	4	4	-1	3	4	3	-1	5

The staff was friendly and everything was in good condition. The room was nice and clean. It's not as glamorous as some of the other properties, but it was frankly a lot cheaper, and the location is just as good.<br/><br/>TI is clearly getting more price aggressive in the down Vegas economy. Complementary wi-fi and a free fitness center visit were welcome.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the men's spa for a few hours. It was very clean and quiet, nicely managed. A good way to get serious quiet time in Vegas.<br/><br/>One extra tip -- The automated check in / check out station in the lobby worked great for me. I skipped every line. Check in took like 3 minutes, check out took 2 minutes.<br/><br/>I would definitely stay at Treasure Island again.	4	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

If you don't want (can't) splurge on Venetian or Bellagio, this is a place to stay in Vegas that combines great location and comfort. If you have realistic expectations, you will enjoy your stay. I actually enjoy TI more than some &quot;luxury&quot; places in Citycenter. At least you get consistent housekeeping, clean towels every day (on time) and around-the-clock restaurants. Of course, there are some issues: dirty laundry bags were laying in the middle of the hall for about a day, staff at the bars and coffee house was surprisingly obnoxious (kind of strange thing for lower-end places). We were there for business, and had to stay at TI due to corporate budget reason, so I will recommend this place for budget-concession travelers that want true Vegas experience and clean rooms.	5	5	-1	4	4	3	-1	5

When we finally got up to our room, we were impressed by the view (strip view on the 30th floor) but not so impressed by the cleanliness of the room. The linens were stained and other minor things (the ice bucket had a hair in it) that we didn't expect to see in a Vegas hotel. When we had questions, the staff were neither friendly or helpful. At check out, the bell men were the opposite of helpful - we waited at our car for 20 minutes for them to wheel out our luggage, and then got dirty looks for not tipping the second bellman (we tipped the guy who picked up our luggage from the room).

We e mailed the hotel beforehand to request inter-connecting strip view rooms and hey presto!.. it worked. The downside was the resort fee which we had to pay for both rooms and at $224 after tax that seemed rather excessive when the kids only used wifi. We couldn't even make use of the boarding pass print service because Virgin's system was down, although that clearly wasn't the fault of the hotel.<br/>Check in was fairly quick. It was relatively easy to find our rooms and we were pleased with our strip view room. We overlooked Sirens Cove and yes, it was noisy when the show took place but isn't that what Vegas is all about??<br/>The rooms were a decent size and the bath tub was large enough to have a really good soak! The toiletries were from the spa and were replenished daily. I was pleasantly surprised at how soft the towels were, given previous reviews. We had no complaints at all.<br/>The beds were ridiculously comfortable and we all got a good night's rest.<br/>The casino was a little smokey but you didn't have to hang around. It was fairly quiet when we were there and one afternoon my dad was a little dismayed that there was only one roulette table playing, which was full and when he asked if they were opening another one, the reply was in the negative. Surely it wouldn't have hurt to open up another table when there were staff available? Maybe they don't want to encourage gambling??? That aside, the casino staff were all really pleasant and patient with me when I tentatively played the tables. The staff in the cage always had a smile whether cashing in travellers' cheques or casino chips!<br/>We ate at Kahunaville for breakfast every morning as everyone found this to be more than acceptable. Portion sizes meant that we didn't need to eat again until dinner time! We tried the buffet on our last evening and although the food was perfectly acceptable we felt that it was a little over priced. We were going to use our two for one vouchers but didn't realise that they had to be used by 6pm, rather early by Vegas standards!!<br/>We saw Mystere and were not disappointed. I wont spoil the surprise, go ahead and book! On our last trip here we stayed at Caesar's Palace. Yes, it was more jaw dropping but at the end of the day if all you want is somewhere to rest your head then TI comes out top!!<br/>All in all this is a decent hotel and as long as you bear in mind the resort fee you will not be disappointed. If we are lucky enough to visit again, TI will be on my wish list! <br/>PS the children loved it too!!!	4	5	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

So worth it! The room was clean and updated. Bed was comfortable. Two bathrooms, one with a jacuzzi tub, the other with a walk-in shower. <br/>The view was what sold us, though. Total strip-view, which was breathtaking. The lobby and casino was very smoky, obviously, but our room (which we had requested smoke-free) was completely clean smelling. No hint of smoke at all.<br/>There was a dent in the wall, which I could understand how that could concern people, but it really didn't bother us. <br/>Really, the only complaint I had our entire stay was the length of the check-in line. Took about 45 minutes. I might say that they need to facilitate that, but on the other hand, we were checking in at 6:30 on a Friday night, so it's probably busy anywhere on the strip.<br/>Great location, right next to the Fashion show mall on the strip. I would definitely stay there again.	5	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

We got a deal where it was around $85 per night and the last night was free. Granted you do have to pay a $20 resort fee, regardless if you use the amenities or not. I would recommend you take full advantage and bring your laptop for the wifi that's included in the fee.<br/><br/>The location of Treasure Island is perfect. Treasure Island is on the strip in the heart of it all and it's located next to a Walgreens where you can buy certain amenities that the hotel offers, but much cheaper. Like alcoholic beverages and coffee and other food items. <br/><br/>Treasure Island isn't glitsy like some of the higher end resorts, however it has a fun atmosphere and is true to the theme without going overboard (pun intended). The resort is clean and not scuzzy. Upon arrival, we were taken care of very quickly and were greeted in a very welcoming and friendly manner. There was no line because it was really late at night when we first arrived. The room we stayed in had been renovated the year before and it was nice and clean. The bathroom was large enough for three women to all get ready in and the floor space in the actual room and closet was more than enough. <br/>Gambling at Treasure Island was fun! I personally enjoyed gambling there during the day. The gambling area is wide open so I didn't feel entrapped or overwhelmed like some other places on the strip. I also thought the dealers at the black jack tables were awesome and friendly. <br/>Bottom line, when you take into consideration the low price that we paid for this newly renovated casino resort, Treasure Island is totally worth it. Give it a go!	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

We received a casino invite so two of our three nights were free. We never had any issues here, I like the rooms and beds are comfy. Mystere was dark during our stay which was a bummer, I've seen almost every show on the strip and Mystere is easily my favorite. I took my daughter to get a mani pedi with me at the spa and it was great. the spa is clean and the girls are very nice. I will definitely stay again.

I chose to stay at TI because they had a great rate and I like that end of the strip, having gotten familiar with it during my stay at the Wynn. TI's location really can't be beat, since it is surrounded by the Fashion Show Mall, Wynn/Encore, Venetian, and Mirage. For a solo traveler, this means there are plenty of dining and shopping options only a short walk away (The Forum Shops at Caesar's are quite close as well). I got a room on the 32nd floor overlooking the Pirate Cove - I couldn't have asked for anything better. The king size bed was super comfortable, and the room furnishing were very classy. Most importantly, the room and bathroom were clean. The bathroom was pretty no-frills, but it was more than adequate and very spacious. The only thing that marred my stay was the very slow wifi in the room, but that wasn't a huge deal. The restaurants within TI are great for a solo traveler, especially the pizza place and the two Starbucks locations. I always felt safe in the hotel. TI's value and location can't be beat - the next time I go to Vegas, TI will be my first choice for lodging.	5	5	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

We seem to always get free rooms at some free play from the casino. Rooms are nice, with good bathrooms and great beds. <br/><br/>The standard room is good, but try to get floor 31 or above. This will give you almost a private elevator, and a guaranteed good view. This may be tough to get, because casino hotels do not want to guarantee you a specific room. When you check in, let them know you are willing to wait for the higher floor if possible, otherwise they just give you the first room that is ready. If you can establish a relationship with a casino host, they may be able to assist. <br/>We were given a low floor, and we had contacted the casino host because it was a special occasion. She called the hotel side and got us a the higher floor. <br/> Casino is a little on the small side, which is not always a bad thing. You won't get lost like we did in MGM. Bartenders are a little too stern about giving out free drinks unless you play $20 or more. With the amount we spend, it is insulting to be accused of freeloading. Waitresses don't care if you are playing anything at all. They will be glad to serve you a drink if you are just sitting at a machine.	4	5	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

I wish I hadn't. This hotel has really gone downhill. I'll seperate the positives and negatives. <br/><br/>The Good:<br/>Check-in was prompt, despite the long line. Arrived around 1pm on a Friday and there were apx 30 people in line. However, the line moved quickly as they had about 12 staff on hand checking people in. Ended up with a nice older woman from NY and asked if they had anything higher up and with a view. I was going to try the $20 trick but have merely asked before and it has worked each time. Lucky for us, she was real nice and got us on the 34th floor with a panoramic view. Room was on the smaller end but suited us fine. Bed was clean and very comfortable (similar to my experience in 2009), and bathroom was excellent. Happy with this part of our stay. <br/><br/>Location of this hotel is superb. Reason why I booked it again for this trip. I much prefer the north end of the strip as it's newer and attracts a less dodgy crowd. However, next time I will definitely pay a bit more to stay at the Mirage, Encore or Venetian. <br/><br/>The Bad: <br/><br/>Resort fee is going up to $25/night, and the amenities are terrible. The casino is poorly ventilated and reeked of smoke. The gaming tables were sparce and the dealers were rude. In one instance I witnessed the dealer in an argument with one of the guests. THis dealer was the same woman who told me I couldn't change my lower chips to higher ones unless i left the table. Brutal customer service. Ate at the Pho restaurant and it was OK. Have eaten at Canter's before and it was not worth the time or money. Atmosphere in the hotel is severely lacking, mainly due to the aging population of the guests they had in during our stay (however, when i was previously here it was more of a mixed crowd, so it may have been an off weekend). The cocktail service was also terrible, at one point, after being at the table for half hour and asking the dealer 4 times for service, I had to get up and track the CW down just to get a 'free' beer! <br/><br/>Overall, if you're looking for a relatively affordable place to sleep on the north end of the main strip, this place has comfortable, and from my experience, clean beds. If you like to gamble at the resort you're staying at this is not the place for you. The Mirage had much friendlier staff, drink service was prompt, and the amenities are much nicer. If you do not like the overwhelming smell of smoke try the Venetian or Wynn (understand this is Vegas, smoking is allowed, but they really need to do something about the ventilation..)	2	4	-1	3	3	2	-1	3

Little Bit and I were just coming in quick to see &quot;Mystere&quot; and then bailing the next morning. I don't like Vegas so my ventures onto the strip are EXTREMELY limited. This trip I was solo and here for the Catersource Convention being held over at Ceasars Palace, so I went onto priceline (name your price) to get a hotel hopefully somewhere NEAR Caesars. I lucked out got a rate of $78.00 per night coming on a Sunday for 2 days. <br/><br/>Rooms are nice be sure to tell them you do not want a room near the Pirate show if you would like to get some sleep... although I didn't hear the show to late in the evening, perhaps it is different in the summer time when they are busier. Service was fine nothing SPECTACULAR but check in was quick and friendly. Gift shop personnal smiling and nice, valet courteous. I had a view of the strip on a high floor it was nice but honestly you spend no TIME in your room so I don't imagine it is important when you really think about it. I could hear my neighbors from time to time so walls are thin (or neighbors were just loud) My classes during the convention were long starting at 7:00am and out by 6:15pm so needless to say I was not in the room for long. Last week the monorail that takes you to the Mirage was broken and they were offering a shuttle to the Mirage but my destination was Caesars so I took a cab each day.<br/><br/>FYI if you use credit cards in the cabs there is a $3.00 transacation fee. I did not partake of the pool but it is a nice size. I did not eat at any of the restaurants here this time so can't review those. Elevators are through the Casino like every other hotel in Las Vegas... as they want you to be tempted to loosen your pockets and &quot;give it a go&quot;!LOL<br/><br/>Respectfully Reviewed	4	5	-1	4	4	3	-1	3

I circled the casino TWICE and finally gave in and asked one of the friendly gamers who pointed me in the right direction. I guess that's how the hotel wrangles you into playing ... by keeping you lost/locked in to the casino area. <br/><br/>The hotel I normally stay in while in the area for business had no rooms available.

Nevertheless, for a quick weekend getaway, I booked with Treasure Island. I settled on a reservation of one room with two beds (upgrades to suites was not an option since the upgrades only had king beds and I was traveling with a friend). <br/>I have to say, the TI experience was wonderful. Clean rooms, nice view of the mountains (on the 22nd floor overlooking Red Rock) and easy check in. Line for check in was short, towels could have been more plentiful (they only put three in the room instead of four) and best of the best, the pool was already open unlike many others. There was an in room safe and even a small refridgerator which came in handy stocking a few drinks from the Walgreens across the street.<br/><br/>The rooms were fairly quiet except for an early evening wrestling match by our neighbors. Nothing hurt, quite comical and we finished getting ready to go out for the evening. lol<br/>Regarding the lack of 5 review vs. 4, I think TI is a bit short on dining options. And with the resort fee, you are given a 2 for 1 buffet pass, but it's not good on Sunday brunch and it's only good from 11-6pm. Sadly, we found this out at 7pm and didn't get to the buffet. Why the limited hours? An inconvenience for your guests, I say.<br/><br/>Location is fabulous, next to Mirage with endless eateries and bars and a walkway to the mall. In house Gilley's was actually quite a nice party scene and local gaming tables were nice also. Recommend.	5	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

I did a lot of research before our trip and was glad that I decided on this one. Main reason is that it has one of the smaller lobbies/casino's in Vegas. No need to walk one mile to get from the driveway to the hotel elevators. It was a 2 minute walk! Close to midnight, they have security checking for room keys before you can access the elevators which was comforting to know. Ask for turndown service. It is complimentary, and includes chocolates and free bottled water. I never had to wait more than 30 seconds for a valet or bellman to help us with our car and shopping bags. There is also a Walgreens across the street, and the hotel is connected to Fashion Mall.<br/><br/>The negative reviews about the long line ups are a &quot;hit and miss&quot; It is almost impossible to know ahead of time if there will be a line up or not. We arrived at approx noon, and there was only one person in front of us, with 4+ front desk agents on standby to help out. At check-out, there was no lineup at all with several front desk agents on hand. It could be luck! I did walk by late night to see how the line up was and there was one evening where there was about 20 people waiting to check-in<br/><br/>I always try and try and not have negative things ruin my vacation. I hated having to pay for the resort fee, but I just thought of it as internet fee which I would've paid for anyways and is accustomed to. The room rate at that time was approx $20 less than the other hotels who are not charging the resort fee.	5	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	5

Ok price buy for a strip hotel, but not worth the stress and low quality. I am disappointed in Priceline's rating system for giving Treasure Island such a high star rating when in reality, the hotel's service and quality is much lower<br/><br/>??heck-in -- I stood in line for an hour and half waiting to be checked in. Apparently, the hotel only has 2-4 employees designated for check-ins. Literally, there were ropes that were zigzagging through the lobby to keep us in a line. Taking 10-40 minutes of time per check-in, the employees worked like they've never checked-in a customer before. <br/><br/>??ed/Sheets/towels quality--they're white and looked clean. But the quality is standard and could use new sheets. In comparison to Tropicana Hotel, Tropicana is newer w/ better quality and comfort beds. Towels were old. Could use new towels.<br/><br/>??omplimentary -- soap, shower gel, shampoo ... they supplied it, but the quality is poor. <br/><br/>??levators --they're fast, but when getting in an elevator, make sure it goes to your floor. Each elevator only goes to a designated floor. <br/><br/>Recommendations - only stay here if you're cheap on price and don't care about quality. Otherwise, there are better places and &quot;real&quot; 4 stars hotels on the strip that you can stay at.	2	4	-1	2	3	2	-1	2

However, instead of our booked king bed we got 2 queen beds but that was fine.<br/><br/>The room was clean with very comfortable beds. The room service was great and the room was cleaned every day.<br/><br/>There was no noise (apart from the pirate shows in the evening) and our stay was really comfortable. <br/><br/>The casino itself is a small but quite ok.

This hotel is right on the strip and in the middle of everything. Lots of shopping, shows and clubs very close nearby! Room was more than adequate...comfy, clean beds, nice colour flat screen TV, decent sized washroom with lots of towels and toiletries, good wi-fi service on my i-pad 2, a great variety of slot machines and tables,etc. I had some difficulty with the strong smell of cigarette smoke in the air in the casino part, even though I did not see anyone smoking.

We were on the 20th floor with a view of the strip and a view of the pirate show. The show was really cool to watch from our room. I have nothing bad at all to say about this place.

Although the restaurants are not as fancy and A-list like some of the other resorts they are still very good and worth a visit. I still think the best burger in Vegas is served in the TI restaurant.<br/><br/>The rooms are lovely! Nice and big, modern with the worlds most comfortable beds. The bathrooms are huge, modern and clean. A++++++++<br/><br/>The swimming pool can get crowded and noisy which wont be to everyones liking but it'll be the same most places you stay in Las Vegas.<br/><br/>Overall this is my favourite hotel that Ive stayed in, in Las Vegas.

I had stayed at TI before, and knew what to expect--- no frills, but clean, friendly, comfy bed and convinient location. The hotel pumps a fragrance into the small-ish casino that some ppl in our party didn't like, but I thought it smelled nice. The casino was not too smoky, compared to other hotels. There is a resort fee, but meh, they are pretty standard. Canters deli was pricey but good, same with the coffee shop... really dissapointed with Gilley's (medicore food-- mine was good- pulled pork salad- but everyone else wasn't happy with their food-- and bad service)<br/>Overall, solid, nice, no frills hotel!	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

We matched with TI on Priceline for $40 a night, and figured it would be a terrible place because we got such a great deal. Nope! Everything was lovely.<br/><br/>Room: The room was huge, modern, and beautiful. We let the person at the check-in desk know that it was our anniversary, and they offered to upgrade us; we got a corner room. This is a very specific pro, but I really liked their bath soap. It has bumps on it, so bathing was like getting a silky massage.<br/><br/>Hotel in general: It was... okay. The casino seemed smoky and not as open as other ones we saw. The attraction, though (the Sirens of TI show) was a lot of fun. The one thing that surprised me about the hotel was that they charge a daily service fee of $20. I take it many Vegas hotels (but not all) do this. They try to convince you that you get stuff for your $20, and I *guess* you do (free wireless internet, a 2-for-1 buffet coupon that we used and enjoyed, a &quot;special screening area&quot; for the Sirens show)... but still... it felt sneaky.<br/><br/>Location: Wonderful. This is considered the north part of the center of the strip. So you're still in the middle of all the action, but you're not in the middle of the middle of the action. We walked most everything (though took a city bus to Freemont St), and thought TI was a great location for walking. There's also a Walgreen's across the street, which means you can buy cheap[er] breakfast foods and snacks there.	4	4	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

I generally had a good time. My video room review can be seen http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYABGJZGCwg&amp;feature=youtu.be . I had a business trip that brought me to the south west, and found a great deal that I could not pass up that brought me to Vegas. TI is a fun resort, lots of places to eat, nice gaming floor, good strip location. I ate breakfasts at the Kuhunaville on site, there are ladies in the casino handing out coupons for the place in the afternoons and early evenings, makes for a great low cost breakfast. Gilly?? restaurant is a good option for BBQ, great rib stacks. I didn?? do the TI Buffet this time as the standard cost is a bit too high for the quality of the buffet, in my opinion. If you stay enough days, the resort will give certificates for the buffet, then it becomes a much better option. The deli shop makes great, HUGE sandwiches, their wings are just OK, nothing special, but a bit greasier than I am use to. There are a few other places in TI to eat, I didn?? try them this time around. My gambling this time around was the poker room, Texas Hold??m tournaments. Didn?? do too well this time around (won last time though). Just a warning if you play Saturday afternoon, there is a local who plays there, he calls himself ??oyman? He tries to get under your skin to make mistakes, just kind of making a PITA of himself. Apparently he does this same stuff when he plays in the world series of poker. I play low buy in tournaments for the fun of playing, and have a more ??un?game instead of serious. I mention this for those who play similarly to me, ??oyman?makes the game a lot less fun than I would like, so watch out, you may want to avoid a tournament if you see him. One other thing of note, TI has a few Star Wars themed slot machines, ??roid Challenge?I think, great fun. I played a long time on those things and didn?? have to donate much money to do so.<br/>TI is located directly next to the fashion show mall. Strip Burger is at the far end, great burgers &amp; fries, and it?? a great place to watch what is going on the strip. Unfortunately I also had to go into the mall as US Airways so nicely destroyed my checked luggage, so I needed to replace it. Let?? just say luggage is a lot more expensive in Vegas than it is in Ithaca, LOL. Anyway, found a decent piece in Macy?? for an acceptable price.<br/>The big thing I did on this trip was go to see a Garth Brooks concert. I grew up listening the Garth, and had never had a chance to see him live till this trip. Loved the show, well worth the cost. It?? pretty much just Garth and a guitar, he plays a good cross section of his big hits, and tells story of how is sound came to be and his influences, a lot of fun. His wife, Tricia Yearwood also comes out, she does a song, and they sing a few songs together, very nice. It?? an expensive concert but well worth the cost for any Garth fans out there. The Encore was decorated for Chinese New Year, so that was pretty cool checking that stuff out. The Encore is worth checking out, very nice place to enjoy a bit.	3	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

If you can't get into one of the better places near the Sands Convention and Exposition Center, you could settle for TI, but unless you're paying little or nothing (I did it last minute for $129), forget about it. The front desk check-in service was slow and indifferent, the parking garage was dingy and dirty, and while the room was quiet and comfortable and clean, the whole place just feels dreary. Overall, TI--aside from the goofy pirate show out front--is very, very average. You can do a lot better. And one last thing, when you book on Expedia (never again), and you show up to check-in, you get shaken down for an extra $20/night internet fee whether you want it or not. Very dishonest, not appreciated.	2	4	-1	3	3	2	-1	3

Things have gone downhill fast in that time. The resort fee charge is a total ripoff and is not explained at check in. The staff are old and grumpy. The beds and pillowws are second rate, both my wife and i came out in a rash after soon going to bed the first night , Bed Bugs we think. The bathrooms arer small and there is no full chair to sit in in the main room. We had stayed at the Belagio for three nights before we moved to TI and the difference is amazing. Pay the extra and stay at Bellagio. The food in the Buffet has deteriorated and only the desert section saves it at all.

Run outside rather than wait for a treadmill, which can take hours. Fruit put out on plates was dented and old. Overall, the best part of the hotel is the location and the ease on getting from the casino to the front door. If you are looking for luxury don't stay here. If you are looking for an easy cheap getaway, its a good choice as long as you don't expect too much.	3	4	-1	4	3	3	-1	3

It is a good location on the strip if you are looking to be near shopping (the mall was very close by).

We have stayed here prior to the change from the pirate theme to the current theme. We were pleasantly surprised by the rooms and decor. The rooms are fairly large for a typical hotel room The furnishings and decor are modern and comfortable. The flat screen T.V is on the small size, but that is the only negative of the room. It was clean and the temperature perfect. They had down pillows and duvets on the bed. The towels were a little bit rough but ok. The bath products were not great quality so I was glad I brought my own shampoo.<br/><br/>We only ate at the coffee shop on this visit. The food was good, but pricey. Also, there weren't a ton of options on the menu. Our waitress was a bit slow so service could have been better.<br/><br/>The casino is larger than I remember. There are plenty of slot machines to choose from. When you needed service at the slots it was hard to find an attendant and the cocktail waitresses were few and far between. However, I won some money so that made the experience all the more enjoyable. I joined the casino rewards program and while I was there (2 days ) I got $95 in free slot play and a free t-shirt. That was pretty good considering I am not much of a gambler. Joining it was worth the 5 minutes it took to sign up. Minimums at the tables were usually at least $10 and that is too rich for my blood. Too many empty tables so maybe they should consider lowering the limit to get people playing - JMHO<br/><br/>Effecient check-in and check-out. Personnel was friendly and efficient.<br/><br/>Only real con of this property? Mandatory resort fee. We didn't use the services and on the first night we checked in at 11:45 pm. I asked them to waive the resort fee for that night and especially for my father-in-law's room as he was only there for the 1 night and they refused. I think it is pretty cheesy to charge that fee when you are 15 minutes away from actually checking in the next day. But we knew what it was going in and with room rates at $44.95/nt we couldn't really complain too much.<br/><br/>I would return to this hotel, especially if the price is that good again. It was a great value for what we got.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Treasure Island seems to have been searching for a new identity or theme since it dropped the Pirates and Treasure theme of the 1990's. At that time it was a fun place to stay, but now it is going downhill fast. Yes, the rooms have been renovated; however, this has been done on the cheap. For instance, there is a desk and hook-up for a computer, but no chair. When we asked for a desk chair, we were told to just pull the lounge chair over to the desk. Not suitable as this chair was too low (we sat on pillows) and much too bulky. The towels most days had obviously been around for years and were unpleasant to use (and smelly--what were they using to launder these?). The restaurants we used to enjoy are now obviously using inferior products, especially the bread. The first place we went to - Canter's Deli - used to be such a favorite of ours. Not this time. The soup was great, as usual, but the corn beef sandwich was not only cold, the bread was so mushy that it stuck to our teeth and the only way to remove it was with a napkin - ugh.<br/>On a positive note, the service everywhere was very satisfactory and the rooms were always refreshed promptly and carefully every morning. <br/>We will not be returning here.	3	4	-1	3	4	4	-1	3

Room was very clean, bed and bedding was truly superb - the most comfortable I have ever experienced in a hotel room. Bathroom could have had better lighting - but maybe that would have been a bad thing in the morning in Vegas ;-) The casino was dark, very dated, and way too smoky for my respiratory system to handle. The bartenders were not that friendly either. Gilley's was fun - always a crowd. We tried the breakfast buffet, which I thought was over-priced, but you do have a lot of options, from cold cereal &amp; fruit, to made-to-order omelets, to sushi and rice. Also ate at Isla, which seemed overpriced and just okay. Sat at the pool one afternoon, which was not very conveniently located. It seemed very clean (it was too cold to go in). You must pass the &quot;pool monitor&quot; first before going in the area - no food, no drinks allowed - although, of course, you can order from their bar and menu inside.	4	5	-1	5	5	3	-1	5

I did have a problem with the resort fee that seems to be very popular on the strip. It doesn't even include WI-FI!! Come on!! Also, in mid march nobody is going to be using the pool.

My friend has stayed there before and my other friend wanted to go to Gilley's, so there we are. When we arrived at check in, we asked that our room be adjoining to our friend's room, or at least on the same floor. She had 1 bed smoking and we had 2 beds smoking. When we got our room it had a great view of the strip and The mirage I loved the view! However, it also only had 1 bed, and we asked for 2. We called downstairs and they apologized and had us come down to get a room switch. We finally got our double beds but were farther from our friend. Our view ended up being of the Trump and Stratosphere, but we didn't care too much about that because we were on the same floor and in the same general area as our friend. I did notice that the people a few doors down from us were smoking weed in their room because you could smell it walking by their room, however it was only the first night. When we went to bed that night my friend noticed a few reddish spots on her sheets so we called housekeeping to come change her sheets. It ended up being rust from the laundry services washers, thank goodness and it was quickly changed with many apologies. The room was very nice, albeit a bit dark. The beds are so comfortable.. I wanted to bring it home! The bathroom was a great size and the tub was very comfortable. The exhaust fan in the bathroom wasn't working but not a big deal to me.<br/><br/>The casino was a good size with some great games! I was so excited that they also have the digital craps game! The casino is a bit smoky but they all are so no big deal. Gilleys was nice too. Our friend had some great times in there. <br/><br/>We ate at the buffet and The Coffee Shop. They both have fantastic food! The buffet has a great diverse selection and homemade donuts! Playing Keno while we ate at The Coffee Shop was fun. There are 2 Starbucks at TI so that was a nice bonus.<br/><br/>All in all, I would definitely recommend TI to people. It's in a great location and has everything you could want for an affordable price.	5	5	-1	5	4	5	-1	5

Located in a prime position at the best spot on the Strip the hotel and casino was to die for. You don't even have to leave to get absolutely everything you want of Vegas!

Everything is clean and the management seems to care about its clientele. It is the best bang for the buck on the Strip In My Opinion. It is next to the Palazzo, the Mirage and the Venetian which are also great hotels. The Pirate show at night is fun to watch from the street or from the Christian Audigier Nightclub, (for which there is no cover fee if you are a guest from the hotel). The drinks are expensive, pretty much like every club on the strip, but nothing special over there. The casino is fun and well designed, but Blackjack Tables are often expensive (Never less than 10$). A standard-basic room comes with an ipod-dock and probably the most comfortable beds I have experience in my lifetime (No joke!) The mattresses are Sealy-brand if not mistaken and they make sure you recover well from hangovers! Quick tip if you want to save money on Booze: Stop at Lee's Discount Liquor Store and drink in your room before going out! (Make sure you leave a good tip to the room service so that they dispose of your empty bottles!). Other than that, the Dinner Buffet on Sundays is very good (around 30$) and you get a lot of good-quality food for that price including fish, meat, sushis, etc. It is the #1 Hotel I recommend if you want to be well located on the Strip but do not want to pay for Wynn, Encore and Venetian prices. Have fun!	4	4	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

The rooms are above standard for Las Vegas more like 4 stars hotel. The location is perfect. It is in the center of the strip right opposite the Fashion Mall and Venetian and Wynn Hotel. It is off Spring Mountain road which has direct exit and on ramp to Freeway 15 and that make it very convenience to get in and out of the strip very quickly	5	5	-1	4	3	3	-1	4

We had a good deal when I booked it through their website and paid $63 per night. Our room was very clean and spacious, the bed was comfy, and the bathroom was pretty big. Check in was a breeze, it only took 5 minutes. The lady gave us our room we requested (higher floor, king bed, and non-smoking) with strip view without extra fee.

Several good restaurants to dine at inside the hotel/casino. Enjoyed many a breakfast at Kahunaville. Gilley's has a great burger! Great location for walking the strip.

Nothing really stands out that makes this place special. The staff and service was excellent, which is what you would expect. My only real negative comment would be in the outdoor show &quot;Sirens of T.I.&quot;. People fill in the entire sidewalk to watch the 15+ minute performance. This is one of the cheesiest shows I've ever seen. Within 2 minutes of it's start, you could hear rumblings in the crowd about the poor quality of the singing, dancing, effects, etc. It was pretty much a waste of time. Oh well, it was only a short waste!	4	5	-1	-1	5	4	-1	-1

TI is connected by foot bridge to the Fashion Mall and is a very short walk away from the Wynn, the Wynn Encore and the Mirage. <br/>Check-in was easy and the front desk staff were very helpful during my stay. It appears that the hotel halls and rooms had been recently upgraded because it looked very fresh and clean. The king room was spacious, tastfully decorated and comfortable. Towels were a little coarse and there was no coffee machine in the room. However, I got a free upgrade to a room with a view of the strip by simply asking. Nice bonus!<br/>If you typically play where you stay when visiting Las Vegas, then I caution you on the casino. I found the TI to be much more smokier then most of the other casinos I ventured in to. It also seemed to me that the weekend crowd was a little rough 'n rowdy (more boots than suits) because of Gilley's bar which is connected to the casino. Let's just say that this is not a place for seniors unless your John Wayne. (RIP)<br/>BTW...if you do stay at TI, take advantage of the TI's Players Club...got a t-shirt and a comp buffet on my 3rd day.	4	3	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

I had a room at the end of the hall, away from the elevators. One thing I loved was the view of the mountains. Every morning I would look out the window for a while before going to breakfast. The best restaurant was Phil's Steakhouse. A little expensive, but the food was wonderful!!! Did not like the smoke filled casino, which you had to pass in order to get to the elevators.

Treasure Island is connected to the Venetian/Sands expo hall by a bridge over the Las Vegas strip. The decor was very bland and tasteless, and the resort fee really was something that I wasn't expecting to pay. Also, the show has gotten much worse. I remember the old Pirates show... was excellent.

Nice spacious room, Updated bathroom	5	0	When we arrived at this hotel at 11:00am, we were able to check in right away - barely any line. Shantei checked us in and gave us an amazing room with a view of the entire strip. We could watch the volcano erupt at The Mirage right from our window. The bathroom was beautiful and quite large with granite countertops and the bathtub was not standard size, much larger. We found an amazing deal on Hotels.com &amp; this hotel ended up being cheaper than Excalibur and Luxor. The casino was clean, staff was friendly, and food was great - even at 2am. Highly recommend this hotel/casino! When we checked in, we also received 2-free buffet vouchers &amp; many other discounts on food/drinks. There was a resort fee of $25 per night, but we knew about this in advance and most other hotels charge this as well.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

The rooms are quite nice and the beds are always comfortable - not too hard. The casino is not too big, and we like it, but -- we could not win a dime this time or the last time we stayed - we did not win anything - before that, we were always more fortunate - we don't think it is a coincidence, based on money spent. I think they should rethink what they have done, i.e. messed with the slots. We might stay at TI again but won't gamble in their casino. Their loss, not ours from now on. Too bad, as they have lots of machines we like.	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

Check in was rude as we used expedia to book....were treated like that was beneath them. Didn't honor the $50 resort credit we were told by Expedia --- which they said was Expedia's fault. <br/><br/>Room was dumpy...I have stayed at the Flamingo often for the cheapness of it ($30 a night sometimes) and expected TI to be a significant upgrade at $160 - $200 per night. It wasn't. Bathroom is dated, the woodwork was chipped up and the tiles in the bathroom were smoke stained. The view outside was clouded by the filthy windows.<br/><br/>The resort fee included wifi in the room only....not anywhere in the hotel. This worked out alright until 2 of the days we were there the wifi signal just dropped. Had to call to get it fixed twice.<br/><br/>Housekeeping came and left without leaving any towels and left a pillow with no case on it. We called to get some towels and pillowcase and were brought them fairly quickly. <br/><br/>After about 20 minutes my hubby and I --- buck naked in our bed --- had another housekeeping employee walk right into the room and stood there and spoke to me while I pulled the covers up over me. She didn't leave even after that. Wow. That was something.<br/><br/>The hotel itself had good amenities, but for the price......the flamingo is about the same quality and is only $30 - $70 a night. I will never stay here again. Ever. I visit Vegas 2x per year.	1	3	-1	2	3	1	-1	4

All my previous trips to Vegas I had stayed at the south end (Hooters and Excalibur) or the extreme north end (Stratopshere). When planning to return, I stumbled upon a big sale for Treasure Island and without even telling my fiancee the price, she said book it because it was TI. <br/>The place is great. Simple as that. First thing I noticed walking through the pedestrian overpass out of the garage area was now nice the place smelled. The lady at the front desk (originally from NYC, forget her name) was very good to deal with and gave us good instructions on how to get to our room. The room was lovely and we had a good view of the mountains and the north part of the strip from the 32nd floor. <br/>The casino was busy (which is a good thing obviously) but not annoyingly crowded. At first I found it a bit tough to navigate to an exit on the strip but the signs lead the way well enough. <br/>The bed was amazingly comfortable and I would absolutely stay again.	4	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

I did alot of research on all the hotels and finally chose TI. WHAT A MISTAKE..... We were told at check in that we where upgraded to a strip view room. Well i dont call 9th floor a good view. Anyway didnt let that bother me until i got to the room. The shower didn't work, had bugs crawling on me allnight and then house keeping didnt reset the alarm from the guest before us and the alarm went off at 5am. So they moved us and gave us a free bottle of wine (which never came). The new room was on the 10th floor and smelt that bad of cigars that it made me sick. They told us that they would go and spray the room and 8 hours later no one had been near it. I spoke to management and told them that this was my aniversary and that room was making me sick. The only solution they came up with was that they could move me back to the room i came from (with the bed bugs....I dont think so) So i said NO.....They said that they were no rooms available, so i offered them more money for a better room which they still said no. So i requested my money back so i could go to another hotel and they told me they could not do that. So long story short i had no choice but to deal with the cigar smell for five days. I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN....and i will be telling all my friends the same.	1	2	-1	1	2	1	-1	3

The room was a fairly typical hotel room, not real big but not too small. Plenty of room for two people. The room was very clean.<br/>The highlight of the stay for me was that the second round of the NCAA basketball was going on and Treasure Island set up a huge movie type screen in the Mystere Theatre that was set up to show 4 basketball at a time.

The hotel security was quick to respond and did a quick look around with a tiny flashlight and left us with the impression that we were lying. We both do work in the industry and know that the key cards record uses in the locks. We were given a copy of the &quot;incident report&quot; and told to call Risk Management in the morning. I did call and left a voice message requesting a return call. No call back. I called again the next morning and was unable to leave a voice message as the mail box was full! Not a good sign, that says alot about the security of this place if the message box is so full you can not leave a message! I left another message this morning that STILL have not gotten a call back.

Never visited in March, and working in the theme park industry, I can't get to Vegas during 'hot weather', so, we wanted a nice pool.if the weather permitted. The Pool area's hot tub is hot, and the pool's water is very pleasant. Great drinks and service provided by Kahunaville. The area is very relaxed with large lounge chairs and fluffy stripped towels for guests.<br/><br/>I love how Phill Ruffin has broken the mold of corporate properties and added individual places to eat. I have visited several Senor Frogs, and can't wait to dine at TI's also.The Buffet is very adequate for the hotel, including a awsome salad station mixed by attendants, and very enjoyable basic desserts including homeade fruit pies ala mode. The pizza joint located by the theatre was packed all day and night. <br/><br/>The room, ours was 35-030, 35th floor, had a most excellent bed, nice flat screen, ipod docking station, wifi, and plenty of bathroom comforts including a large tub, shower gel, other Oleksandra Spa exclusive products. We paid an additional $10 for a 'Strip' view, and from the bed, you could view sunrise, the Bellagio Fountains, and from the window, you could look down and view the Mirage Volcano.<br/><br/>The casino floor still produces the sweet spice aroma of the Carribbean, and music is not loud. The entire staff was friendly, from painters doing touch up work, to dealers, retail, f/b, and valet. They actually held our bags after we checked out of our room while we ate prior to departure. When we retrieved our bags, they took them to the cabs, no lifting needed.<br/><br/>TI does have a resort fee. We used the Buffet BOGO, the free drink, in room wifi, Sirens VIP viewing, and printed our Southwest boarding passes at guest services. Our 'My TI' (online club) quoted price was $49, and with taxes, resort fees, etc., we averaged only about $72 a night. It was worth every penny. We intend to stay here again. <br/><br/>Its great to stay at a place filled with happy pirates, whether they work there or are visitors.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

We stumbled upon Treasure Island while perusing Kayak and thought that $75/night wasn't too bad, so we booked it. Located near the end of the hustle and bustle of the main strip, across from the Trump Tower and Fashion Show Mall we found the hotel no problem but parking was a little bit tricky. Check in was speedy but we encountered grumpy guests as well as grumpy front desk staff (there's not much one can do about that!). Because we had already prepaid, all that was left was the $25/day resort fee which seemed a little steep. The fee includes wireless internet access ($17.99/day otherwise), 2 for 1 buffet voucher, 2 for 1 cocktail voucher and fitness center passes - not a great deal but was necessary because we had school work and assignments from work that had deadlines while we were here. Rooms were clean and comfortable and our 16th floor room had a beautiful view of the mountains and skyline. Bathrooms were large and clean and nothing was broken, out-of-place or outdated. There is a small safe and itty bitty fridge that we stocked with some wine, bagels, milk and fruit (breakfast isn't included). Overall, the experience was great. Of course things are going to be pricey in the heart of Vegas but the location was on par and the rooms were comfortable. For those coming to Vegas, do your research and have an open mind.	4	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

We did not pay for an upgrade so it is what was expected. The room was clean and the beds are very comfortable.

Of all the places i have stayed this is probably my least favorite so far. The location is convenient, but everything in the hotel and that area is extremely overpriced.

The room was a good size, spotless, and very comfortable and quiet. The bed was great, one of the best of all Vegas hotels I've stayed at. The bathroom was large and the toiletries were nice (from the in-house spa). We had a flat-screen tv in the bedroom area, and a nice chaise-lounge in the sitting area.<br/><br/>Gaming:<br/>I'd suggest joining the TI Players Club as soon as you get in, because with all our table and slot play over 2 days, we got $100 taken off our in-room charges for dining. The only bummer is the card does not connect with any other hotels- it's not part of MGM nor Harrah's, so you have to play at TI extensively (or exclusively!) to get comps. The dealers and staff were all nice and helpful, but we did have one very bad experience with a brand new 3 card poker dealer who mis-dealt 3 hands in a row, and the pit boss who came over argued with all of us at the table. We took our chips and left. That was an isolated incident, though. <br/><br/>Dining: <br/>We received two free buffet passes, which we used on our departure day, and it was excellent. There was so much to choose from-- pasta, pizza, sushi, Mediterranean, Build-a-burger, custom-made salads, and a great dessert bar (it even had a cotton candy machine!). We ate at Gilley's twice (Western theme), and it was good both times, and once at the Pho (Vietnamese) restaurant which hit the spot. We also ate at Kahunaville for breakfast, and sat outside by the pool, which was nice, even though the pool area's music was really loud for 9am. We couldn't complain too much, since the prices were really good.<br/><br/>Location:<br/>This hotel is located next to the Mirage, and across from Palazzo and the Venetian- and walking distance to just about everything else. It's a bit of a hike to cross the street, but you can cross at Mirage on the street, or take the overpass up and over to Palazzo.<br/><br/>We really liked staying at TI, and would do it again, even though the Player's Club is for TI play only!	5	4	-1	5	4	4	-1	5

This hotel is the right size and the right price, we've stayed at other resorts on the strip that can take over 15 minutes to find your room and that gets old real quick. The only thing we didnt like was the buffet onsite, wasnt worth the money. The pool was small but very nice. The tram connecting TI with Mirage was very helpful, it saved our tired legs a few steps. I would reccomend staying here if youre looking for a barrgin, totaly worth the price.	5	3	-1	3	4	4	-1	3

By signing up for TI Members Only emails, I gained access to incredible bargain rates that tipped the decision for our stay to Treasure Island. We liked that fact that TI isn?? one of those behemoth hotels that requires a 20 minute hike to get to your room. Plus, rooms were recently remodeled and our deal came with two free buffets.<br/><br/>At check in we were told our room had a resort view (i.e., overlooking the pool). While technically true, we ended up with a great view of the Strip, looking south. We were also given a buy one get one free buffet coupon for a weekday lunch or dinner.<br/><br/>Our room was obviously fairly new, with lots of dark wood and a modern design. We were especially impressed with how large the bathroom was. The carpet was a busy pattern designed to hide dirt, but closer inspection revealed a carpet in serious need of steam cleaning. There were lots of stains. The rooms also aren?? very soundproof and you might consider bringing earplugs to block out the noise of late night revelers and slamming doors in the wee hours.<br/><br/>TI has a great selection of in-house restaurants. The buffet space is also recently remodeled and very attractive. We used our freebie coupon for dinner and enjoyed an expansive buffet with a Southern themed menu for the main section ?bbq, sweet potatoes, greens and chicken fried steak were all passable. It was supplemented with a pasta performance station, baked potato bar, a basic sampling of Chinese food, some Mediterranean appetizers and sushi. The best part was the made to order salad station and the dessert buffet. Do not pass up the mini donuts with caramel icing that have been warmed under a heat lamp! Or the chocolate dipped strawberries! We were surprised, and disappointed, to find the exact same menu a couple of days later at lunch, with the exception of the baked potato bar which had been replaced by out of the box frozen seafood selections.<br/><br/>Canter?? Deli was incredible, offering large portions of delicious fare at affordable prices. Think typical Jewish deli. The matzo ball soup and pastrami sandwich are real treats and not to be missed. Kahunaville is a party bar that opens for breakfast, too. Be on the lookout for someone handing out coupons in the casino for their $7.99 breakfast special.<br/><br/>Treasure Island may not have the glitz and glam of some Las Vegas resorts, be we found it to be a great value in a great location.	4	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

The check in was very quick, we had booked through their marketing and were able to save ourselves from paying the resort fee. When we checked in we asked if any complimentary upgrades were available, and sure enough we were upgraded to a strip view room, and given 2 free buffet passes, I've always stayed on the other end of the strip, but this was conveniently located near the fashion show mall, and the Venetian where we play poker. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone going to Vegas!	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1

Long line at check-in but it did go fairly quick with at least 10 people working the front desk. Also T.I. did early check in at 11am which was very helpful. While waiting they had a nice lady passing out free bottles of water. Got a room with a great strip view . Room is starting to show its age. Smaller tv with very limited channels. Also the towels need to be upgraded as they have seen their best days long ago. Those minor negatives were made up by the friendly staff. It was a very busy weekend due to spring break and march maddness. Never had to call to have room cleaned . Staff was always on top of it. Also due to such demand I paid a premium for the room. If you can find rates for under a 100 a night you won't be disappointed.	3	4	-1	3	4	4	-1	-1

The resort package included five days, four nights and airfare and was definitely worth the bargain. The check in was super quick, the hotel staff was friendly and the pool was awesome. On Thursday morning the pool area turned into a &quot;pool party&quot; and there was a DJ and dancing (very cool). The pina coladas at the pool were by far the best I've ever had (and I'm definitely a pina colada aficionado). The only thing I didn't like was that we requested a king sized bed and instead were given two queens. The beds were super comfortable but still not what I wanted. Tip: If you sign up for the Treasure Island Card, your resort fees are waived and make sure you check out the FREE pirate show.<br/><br/>We're planning on going back in July 2012 and staying at TI - hopefully with the right bed this time!	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

This is the first time in 4 years that I have not had to fight with the booking staff to get the room that I had reserved 6 months in advance I think it?? ironic that they want you to reserve your room tell them how many of you there will be, smoking or non, King, Queen, 2 beds or 1, handicapped etc. Only to arrive and have them give you a totally different room than you requested! I have had this issue with many top name Hotels in Las Vegas in the past. And I was prepared to blow a gasket this year, after parking at one end of the building dragging my luggage all the way a crossed the busy casino ??itch for some STUPID reason is the norm in Las Vegas?I approached the counter already miffed and agitated only to have the nice lady say Mr. Brown we have you booked for 2 adult twin beds smoking is that correct?? WOW! Now teetering on my hills about to tip over she pushes me on over, ??s there anything else you need or would like to request??Dam! My head hit the floor!!<br/>And then the room was nice, clean, up-to-date, lots of pillows, roomy etc. No peeling paint no poorly matched paint touchups, actually had a real tub! A deep tub!!, big clean mirror, a spot mirror, a fridge, safe, blow dryer, iron etc. the way a hotel should be! I did have to get my coffee maker out of my bag but now days that?? a given. We did have an issue with the TV the second night upon returning to our room at 11, it would not do anything but boot up called front desk they said they would send IT support up?? At 11:00 pm? Yea I??l be seeing them in the morning! But within a half an hour there was a knock on the door!! WOW!!	5	4	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

The hotel was updated in 2008 and the common areas, rooms and casino are in excellent shape. The theater they have for the Mystere show is fantastic as was the show which I will review separately. Check in and out was a breeze with the staff friendly and efficient. My only negative comment was the cost verses the value of the meals in the resorts restaurants. This seems to be the trend on the strip but that doesn?? make it right.	3	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Long line at check-in, only 4 front desk clerks, took over 20 minutes to get served. I had booked the room on their website. When I got to the desk they told me my reservation for the petite suite, that none were available. Rep then talked to manager, then offered me handicapped room with no jacuzzi tub. Told her not acceptable, talked to manager again finally after another 20 minutes got my room. This was a 4 day stay. The buffet, coffee shop and the mexican restaurant were great. The food was excellent and reasonably priced. The room had a light burned out in one of the bathrooms, the toilet was leaking in one of the bathrooms, the shower in my bathroom was only giving lukewarm water. The bathroom sink was slow in draining. These things should have been noticed and fixed before we got the room. The reason we booked this room was because of the 2 bathrooms, one with the shower and one has a jacuzzi tub., great layout for a room. If you are playing the slot machine games they were tight. Machines are looser in Reno. They are slow in answering the phones if you call housekeeping or the front desk. We had to tell the bell captain in person about the burned out light, when we got back to our room it was fixed. All in all Customer Service has a lot to be desired here, except where we ate where the service was great. The petite suite room with the bathrooms was why we booked here. I would be hard pressed to book here again, but might.	3	3	-1	3	3	2	-1	4

Thank you, to whoever came to my rescue when i needed housekeeping really fast! I didn't like not being aware that the resort fee was not optional. I pre-paid for my room and had no idea there was addtional money I had to pay. I was told upon check-in about the fee but not informed it was being charged, regardless if I was to use any additional services that the resort fee would normally include. The bedding was incredibly soft, but I'm not sure how I got one king size bed for two women, when I booked to queen size beds.	3	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	3

Cheaper than Mirage.	4	0	We have stayed here several times. Only two things we don't like: (1) Resort fee and (2) Their buffet is mediocre. Love Canter's Deli! Order a large sandwich and a bowl of soup. It easily feeds 2. (We have never been changed a fee for &quot;sharing&quot; food there.) Outstanding location: Across from Venetian, near the Wynn, Caesars, etc. The Fashion Show Mall is right next door. Within walking distance (maybe 1/2 mile) of Flamingo, Bellagio,Paris, Cosmo, etc. The silly pirate show is alright (like a stunt show at a theme park). We have stayed at nicer, but each room has: flat-screen TV, nice bed, fridge, wall safe, ironing board, decent furniture, and is about 500+ sq. ft. (Needs a microwave). Still a good price in spite of the useless resort fee. Usually cheaper than Mirage, which is right next door with the tram. See &quot;Mystere&quot; if you can.	5	5	-1	4	3	3	-1	4

We were very pleased with our choice. As mentioned elsewhere, the rooms are updated and we found both the rooms and the corridors very clean. Mattress was surprisingly comfortable. We stayed at Paris recently and the TI room was in much better shape than a similar room at Paris. Neither check-in nor check-out entailed a long line. Others mention the smoke in the casino. Yeah, it's bad (as is the gross air freshener they pump in). My allergies went WILD. Had that smell at all permeated the room, we would've checked out immediately, but the air quality in the room was just fine. I coped by rushing through the casino to and from the elevator--a minor inconvenience, but worth it given the value. My husband and I would not hesitate to book again.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Then there is the ones that just want a convient place to stay that is clean and close to everything, and those that just expect it to be just like home.......This hotel is clean, nice, and close to the heart of the strip. I dont think its a hotel like Belliago where you are pampered in luxury, but then again your not paying those prices. The one thing I liked about TI is that you dont have to walk a mile to get somewhere! you want to gamble take the elevator down and your there, you want to eat walk a few steps your there, want to hit the strip short walk thru casino and your there! To me thats what makes it nice to stay at TI. <br/><br/>The room is nice size, we had a strip view very nice for the short time we went to the room, but your in Vegas what are you doing in the room anyway???? <br/><br/>I found the resturants to be nice, the Pho and Beach one, can't remeber the name but its by the pool. The food was good and large protions. We spent one day at the pool, I have nothing but good things to say about the pool and the staff, waitress were very attentive and the food and drinks they brought out were awesome!<br/><br/>Gambling was ok, but I am Black Jack player so there was limited tables open, I noticed at all casinos we visited alot of tables were closed?? so the limits were min of $15 a hand, unless its was late at night then I found a couple drop to $10. The casino is not smokey, I do see some people complain that it is, but its a casino people smoke!<br/><br/>also the beach bar at night was fun the bartenders put on a show and the drinks are good.	4	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

The service in our room was great, but our friends in an adjoining non-suite room had very poor housekeeping service. It was fair value but a few things will prevent us from staying again. We did not care for the food choices and there was far less choice than at many casinos. Cantor's Deli was overpriced and we sent back a soup as it was far too salty. The buffet was mediocre at best. There was also no bar or lounge to enjoy some live music in the evenings. Finally the casino was fairly dark and smokey compared to some of the others. We found ourselves travelling to neighbouring properties whenever we left our room. Next time I'd probably pick PH in the same price range or pay a bit more for Bellagio or Venetian/Palazzo - all of which are properties that I have stayed at in the past and enjoyed more than TI.	4	3	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

I asked for Floor 31 or higher due to the express elevator and stayed in Room 31015.<br/>Very modern with dark furniture, flat screen TV, king sized bed (nice and comfie) and duvet.<br/>A working safe, small fridge to keep your beer or juices chilled with easy access to the ice machine on the floor.<br/>Ladies: The bathroom was nice and large with great toiletries and a magnifying mirror. A hairdryer and iron were provided also.<br/>Disabled: As a former therapist, this room had plenty of access for a wheelchair to include the bathroom and grab bars on the bath tub.(non slip)<br/>Restaurants: Ate at some polynesian restaurant and found the back area to &quot;see the show&quot; not as much fun as the front bar area. The &quot;show&quot; turned out to be water fountains which splashed up every 15 minutes!! VERY expensive food and drinks.<br/>Gilley's bar and restaurant was our favourite. Saloon type atmosphere with line dancing and neat saddle bar stools!! ( and we are NOT country fans folks!)<br/>Buffet: Ate in evening. $23.94 per person. Not bad with awesome cup cakes and dipped strawberries for desert.<br/>Staff: All very nice and friendly.<br/>Slots: Not big gamblers, but won zero.......when walking through casino we never heard a &quot;whole lotta machines paying out&quot;. As non-smokers we did NOT find the atmosphere smoky.<br/>Check In: The worse part. Arrived at 6 pm in the evening and there was a 51 person line up. Having been in airport and shuttle line ups for hours before; this was not a welcome sight. There were 4 clerks who were friendly and effricient, but people were tired and irritable!<br/>Check Out: Fast and efficient. (viewed statement on TV first) at 9 am<br/>Of note however was the Check IN was not operational until 10 am. People who were either delayed or arrived early had to leave their luggage with a Valet and wait until clerks available. A negative.<br/>Access to Strip: excellent.<br/>Resort Fee: Terrible. I was told a fee of $20 per day per room was to be charged.(plus tax) As I had booked in Feb this was honoured. The other travellers were advised that the new rate was $25 plus tax. Wow!! Sure you got free internet and a few vouchers for 2 for 1 drinks and one buffet 2 for 1; but this does not merit this cost I am afraid.	3	5	-1	5	5	3	-1	5

We stayed in Vegas for 5 nights in total, but the first night was a Saturday, and the price increased dramatically at TI for the Saturday night, so we stayed elsewhere then moved over on the Sunday.<br/><br/>The location is very good, and nearly everything else in a similar location is a significantly higher price. It is next to Fashion Show, and across the road from Venetian and Palazzo. Bellagio and Caesars Palace are a short walk away, and a bit further to MGM and New York New York (walkable if you don't mind walking, otehrwise a cheap taxi if you are short on time).<br/><br/>Service was very efficient yet friendly. The rooms are large, with comfortable bed and bathroom in good working order. You can pay extra for a view of the strip, but even without this we still had a view over the pirate ship. There is plenty of parking. The food/drink options are decent enough but we preferred to go elsewhere to eat and drink. The bar in the centre of the casino makes good cocktails though.<br/><br/>This is a great option for those who want to be near the centre of the action on the strip but don't want to pay huge prices for the.... classier establishments.

We've been to Vegas before and knew what to expect. We picked Treasure Island because of it's location in the heart of the strip action and it was very reasonably priced for the quality of the hotel. The rooms were very comfortable and we had a nice view of the strip facing south. Since it was a quick stay we didn't have much time to enjoy the facilites but we did have Happy Hour drinks and appetizers in Isla restaurant, and I have to say the service was great and the food was the best Mexican we've ever had. We didn't have time for a full meal, but for sure next time. The casino area is typical and we spent some time playing the slots and managed to get out with a little more than when we went in. Gilley's Bar off the casino was also a lively spot. Fun place. We had late night drinks and snacks in the dining area and again service and food was great	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Most horrible was my experience. planned to get a wax and massage at thier spa. w<br/>Was told it would be right after each other.

I didn't want to pay the Venetian's rates, so I stayed right across the street at Treasure Island. I paid 141/night for a room with a view of the strip, and booked and prepaid through Kayak.com which meant that I did not have to pay a resort fee. By not paying the resort fee, I didn't have wifi or access the the fitness center, but I didn't think that was worth an extra $28/night. I was very pleased with my room, very spacious and clean with nice furnishings. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was very nice as well. The TV was kind of a low quality flat screen, but I didn't go to Vegas to watch TV. The location of TI can't be beat. It has a pedestrian bridge that connects to the Fashion Show Mall. And there is a Strip/Downtown Express bus stop in front of the mall, so you can easily travel down the strip, to the convention center, downtown, or to the Prime Outlets. Plus the Mirage is next door and the Wynn/Encore and the Venetian/Palazzo are across the street, so easily walk over and access all that they offer. I didn't really care for the restaurants at TI, but there are plenty of nice offerings nearby (Tip: if you wan't a more affordable meal, you can walk over to the mall foodcourt). The only real complaint that I have is that the hallway got kind of noisy on Saturday night, because there were a number of parties in other rooms.	5	5	-1	4	4	3	-1	3

For a strip hotel it's pretty decent. The room (suite) had two bathrooms and a nice view of the strip. It was very quiet and clean, although there were obvious cigarette burns on the carpet even though it was a non smoking room - no smoke odor though. The staff I came in contact with were helpful and pleasant. The coffee shop for breakfast was okay, but I didn't think much of their buffet compared to other strip hotels. I'm not a big gambler, so I really don't have any comment on the gaming. We come for the restaurants and the shows about once a year. We stayed three nights and had a nice package at a good price. Would I return, maybe, but there are other properties we enjoy more such as Bellagio, which is our favorite.	5	4	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

Hotel is very nice for the price, and the location is unbeatable. We were going to the Garth show at the Wynn, so the close proximity was great. Hotel is clean and staff was friendly. Used the &quot;$20 Bill Sandwich&quot; to get upgraded to a strip view on a higher floor. <br/><br/>Bellman brought up our bags, and asked how the room was. We had noticed a wet wash cloth, so he said he'd take care of it, and cleaning staff was there with new towels in 20-30 minutes. Everything else was nice, casino staff was friendly. Buffet was not good - you can read my review on that if you'd like more info. <br/><br/>We didnt use the pool or very many amenities, we did take a shuttle from hotel to airport, but had to pay ,was not included in resort fee.	4	5	-1	4	3	5	-1	4

Otherwise, clean room, fine service in the buffet, no complaints. The location was good on the strip.

The room price we paid for the time period we were there (over a weekend during college spring break and March Madness) was most reasonable in comparison to prices of neighboring resorts, Encore, Wynn, Palazzo and Venetian. The good rates we were quoted by TI were more or less matched by expedia but expedia added a $100 Mastercard credit so we booked with it.<br/><br/>The only thing that tarnished this otherwise very nice stay was the 'mandatory' resort fee of $25, plus tax, making it $28 a day. At checkin we asked if we could simply pay for daily internet which was $18 a day. No, we were told, this is a 'mandatory' fee. For this fee we received: a coupon good for $20 off our next stay (if booked directly with TI); one 2-for-1 buffet coupon ($27 for dinner per person) which we didn't use; one 2-for-1 cocktail (a margarita in our case from the Steakhouse, $9 plus tip and tax; access to the spa and exercise room which we didn't use and internet which didn't connect in our room. So we would carry our Netbook to the bar off the lobby or use it on the table near the elevator on our 32nd floor. We would have simply gone across the street to the Starbucks in the Mall and used it there but for the 'mandatory' fee we were paying. <br/><br/>(We've paid resort fees at other Vegas resorts as well, but as frequent travelers there we also believe that guests should be given the option of not paying the fee if not using any of the services or benefits it provides.)<br/><br/>Our room: The room was spacious and our request for a high floor was met with a room on the 32nd floor overlooking the pirate show to the front of the hotel. Two small maintenance matters were taken care of shortly after we called them to the attention of housekeeping. We had a small empty refrigerator (a plus when compared to Wynn's or Encore's stocked bars that result in charges if you remove and look at an item for too long a period). As others have noted, our king-sized bed was most comfortable. Bathroom supplies included lotion, shampoo, bath gel and conditioner from the resort's Oleksandra spa. Housekeeping was always to the room by 10 a.m. and did a thorough and rapid job of cleaning (unlike Caesar's where it wasn't unusual to not have service until late afternoon).<br/><br/>Dining: For those who do want a buffet, the one at Treasure Island seems popular. Long lines often form prior to the restaurant's opening for breakfast, lunch or dinner. It's small popular coffee shop also draws lines of waiting customers. And Gilley's, the country western restaurant that opens off the casino as well as off The Strip has steady crowds of diners, drinkers and dancers.<br/><br/>Casino: Although the resort underwent a massive rennovation and the rooms reflect it; the casino still has an old Vegas feel to it with low ceilings and a rather dark interior in the gaming and sports book areas. It is smokey in comparison to neighboring casinos.<br/><br/>Pool: There is a large pool and ample lounging areas surround the pool. Our vist fell during spring break so the pool was mobbed with young people on a Saturday afternoon but there were plenty of lounge chairs available during the remainder of our stay.	5	5	-1	5	4	4	-1	5

We paid a little extra for the strip side view and for us it was worth it. The room was nicely decorated and everything worked fine. Made use of the 2/1 drink card and the pool area, but in short time we had the buffet and a couple other perks of the resort fee were not used. Verizon phone service in the casino and club areas is a little sketchy compared to other hotels close by. The pool area and service was great. We were out in the earlier part of the day, so most everything was still clean.<br/><br/>Wish we would have had time for Gilleys, the Sirens and Mystere, but too many other things on the list this time. Would definitely try staying here again if the price was right. It was fair compared to other hotels in this range and definitely had plenty of energy and guests from young to old. Really appreciated the refridgerator in the room.	4	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

Neither of us gambles so it was kind of ironic that we would spend four nights in a casino hotel and I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about what I would find. It's pretty obvious that the vast majority of Vegas visitors are there to gamble but we had a great time during our stay.<br/><br/>Treasure Island is a fairly large hotel with plenty of rooms and a number of restaurants on site. We received a complementary pass for the buffet restaurant during our stay and so one night we ate &quot;The Buffet&quot;. The line was long but it moved along fairly fast. The restaurant was quite full but they did a good job of keeping the platters full. Nothing gourmet but it was tasty and we left satisfied, and full! The only other time we ate at Treasure Island was after a late tradeshow when my sister HAD to have a meal. I skipped dinner that night and I was glad I did. She had a burger in &quot;The Coffee Shop&quot; and after a lengthy wait got an overpriced, tired looking burger and fries. Ugh.<br/><br/>Our room was nicely appointed and good sized. We each had our own queensize bed and they were quite comfortable with decent pillows. The bathroom was also clean and adequately sized. We had plenty of space and never felt cramped or crowded. My only complaint about our stay would be our loud neighbors two of the four nights. I was glad I brought my earplugs but even so found it hard to get back to sleep once they returned to their room and loudly celebrated their winnings (or were they complaining about their losses? Who knows!) <br/><br/>If I have any complaint (besides our noisy neighbors, which can happen at any hotel) it would be the daily resort fee of $25.00. We didn't use most of the services offered and it would have been nice to be able to opt out but you can't do that. However, we knew about the fee when we booked our room, so we just considered it a cost of staying there and even with the fee added to the price of the room, it was still less expensive than the neighboring hotels.<br/><br/>Treasure Island's location on the strip was very handy for us. We were able to walk to most of the tradeshows and only needed to catch a cab once. Nice! They have an overpass over the busy street right in front of the hotel so you can cross over without risking life and limb. Close to the hotel are a Starbucks where we picked up our breakfasts two of the five mornings and there's also a Walgreens across the street where you can stock up on water, munchies and any other necessities you might have left at home.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a good trip and even though I don't care to gamble, when we return for the next season's tradeshows, I'd be happy to stay at Treasure Island again.	4	5	-1	4	4	5	-1	3

We had 2 comp'd nights at Caesars Palace (Agustus Tower) &amp; needed 2 nights elsewhere, the price was right at T.I ($79per night) so we booked it! <br/><br/>Here's a little background. This was my 2nd trip to Vegas, my first visit was in 98' and we stayed in a Players Suite at the MGM Grand. My husband has been there several times for business staying on the companies dime he's stayed at Monte Carlo, Caesars Palace, Wynn, Encore &amp; MGM Signature Towers.<br/><br/>I was surprised how busy Las Vegas was in general. It became obvious from our packed flight, the lines at the airport &amp; the ridiculously long line at the check in at Treasure Island. We arrived at about 3PM. They had at least 10+ agents checking people in so it wasn't like they were understaffed, just a lot of people. It took us about 40 mins to get through the line, we didn't bicker when they gave us a room on the 14th floor mountain view. We just wanted a clean room and we got it! We were pleased with the room over all. Small refrigerator was nice as there is a Walgreens across the street we picked up a few snack items. <br/>Bathroom was large and clean. The lighting wasn't the best for putting on makeup, they do have a small lighted makeup mirror which helped. Hairdryer is always on my list of things &quot;to pack or not to pack&quot; and I was worried when I saw the Conair 1875 Watt in the closet, but my thick curly locks survived since the humidity is low in Las Vegas (9% according to the weather) I survived with this standard appliance. Bed was very comfortable, linens were also better than most hotels in this price category.<br/><br/>The weather wasn't ideal the first 2 days we were there so pool lounging was not a top priority, so I don't have info on the pool.<br/><br/>There is a tram that runs between the Mirage &amp; T.I. which was nice especially since we were moving to Caesars Palace after our first 2 nights. The short walk between Mirage and Caesars was and easy one with just a small carry-on. No restrictions on luggage on this little tram.<br/><br/>The casino at T.I. was not that good to us, but the atmosphere was good. Not as smokey as some of the other casinos we went too. I guess that could be different any given day you go. <br/><br/>We ate at Kahunaville one night. The portions were very large and food was good. They have a great bar scene with &quot;dueling bartenders&quot; if you will. It's loud and rowdy while they are doing their flair competitions but still fun to watch. FYI- if you order a large drink be prepared to drink it- and- be even more prepared to pay for it!!! Hubby ordered a Captain N Coke and it was $24! FYI- Our entree's were 24.99 each. <br/>We also ate at the buffet- once for dinner and once for lunch. Standard buffet with a few exceptions. I thought the salad bar was nice. Its not your standard pick it yourself salad bar. They have servers who will make you different types of salads- Cobb, Caesar, Greek, Chinese Chicken ect. Or they will make you whatever you want. I also enjoyed the dessert station. I'm a sucker for cotton candy so I had to have that once. My husband isn't a big pasta eater, but he really enjoyed the 2 different seafood dishes the pasta station chef made for him.<br/>We REALLY enjoyed the Mystere' (Cirque Show)! My husband saw Love a few months back and he said that they were equally good. He would see them both again! <br/><br/>I hope this report was helpful to those considering staying here. Feel free to send me a message if you have other questions.	5	4	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

The resort fee, which I was okay with paying, is somewhat odd since, each time you try to log into the internet it tells you that you'll have to pay $17.something per computer logged in, so we weren't sure if we should continue. My son also cut his hand on the shower head when trying to change the water flow because it was so sharp.. <br/><br/>The pool area is okay, when we visited it was quite windy, so the blocked off location is nice. It was hard to find a chair at times because people would lay towels down and leave, and not knowing which those were it was hard to tell. <br/><br/>The restaurants were abysmal. We had a breakfast in the buffet (2-1) that none of us were impressed with, lunch in the coffee shop/cafe which had possibly the worst service ever, and dinner at Kahunaville, this had good food, but terrible service. The Starbucks in the lobby also was terrible, I've never had bad Starbucks in any one that I've been to, but this watered down version was terrible. <br/><br/>Mystere - was amazing. This was a great show, and I'd highly recommend it. The &quot;new&quot; sirens show was boring and unimaginative. <br/><br/>All-in-all it was an okay stay, just don't eat there and be prepared for sheets that are stained.	3	4	-1	3	2	2	-1	4

That said I choose this hotel as I was on a business trip so watching my expenses and as I was in Vegas for a 5 night convention being held at the Venetian and the TI offered good value for money room rates in comparison to the Venetian... which was charging convention delegates $250 per night ...I paid $500 for five nights at the TI which is just across the road and with easy walking access to the Venetian (10 minutes from my room in the TI to the Venetian Convention area walking!). I booked a deluxe room with strip view and the room was perfectly adequate, large and clean although the furnishings are a little dark, maid service was good and punctual ...I have stayed in other Casinos in the past and they can come late in the day. The TI does charge a $25 per day resort fee, but it includes WIFI in the room, but not the public areas which is strange - you also get a couple of other extras but nothing to shout home about. I arrived over the weekend so it was rather noisy due to a lot off younger guests enjoying themselves Vegas style ....that said once Monday arrived there was a noticeable change in the quality of guests ..for the better. The Reception staff were very helpful and friendly but the some of the food outlet staff were a bit surly, particularly in the Coffee Shop and the Asian. The Isla offers good Mexcian food and passable service. Hotel also has a pleasant pool area and makes a welcome oasis to relax in - it did get a little busy, but you could still find a quiet spot away from the &quot;party&quot; crowd if you looked around. For those of you looking for shopping then the TI is ideally placed with the Fashion Mall and the Forum on either side of the hotel ...so watch that credit card...lots to spend on in both places!! Overall a good stay for a business trip and as long as you realize it is not like its larger more glamourous neighboring hotels, then its does offer good value and a great location for a short stay in Vegas	5	5	-1	4	5	3	-1	4

We used the &quot;TV offer&quot; available from the TI website for our stay. We stayed from Sunday through Thursday and the room rate was about $79 per nigth with NO resort fee (yay!). It also coame with a bogo coupon for a buffet at TI, Cirqu de Sole Mystere, and beer at Giley's. Also received a coupon for 20% off at the spa.<br/><br/>I recommend that you get there as early as possible. Our flight arrived at 11:15 and we called TI and was told that early check in was noon. We went straight to the hotel and only had to wait about 15-20 minutes to check in. Later in the day the check in lobby looked like a reugee camp. I bet those folks waited an hour or more to check in. Get there early.<br/><br/>When we checked in I offered the desk clerk $20 and asked if she had any available upgrades for first timer celbrating their 25th anniversary. She upgraded us to a corner suite (room 27036) and hooked us up with a complimentary bottle of champagne. We had views of the Mirage volcano and the Rio and the mountains out the other window (see attached photos). Some folks in other reviews complained about noise from the volcano, but it wasn't an issue for us.<br/><br/>The bed in the room was very very comfortable. There was a mini fridge and safe - we used both and they worked well. The room was very clean and housekeeping changed the sheets everyday. The TV was mounted on a wall 90 degrees from the head of the bed and the channel selection was very limited - but you're not in Vegas to sit in the room and watch TV - right? :)<br/><br/>Also loved they had certain sets of elevators that accessed different floors. Our elevators went to floor 1-3 and 25-29. So, there was never a long wait to get an elevator (up or down).<br/><br/>Only thing holding this hotel back from 5 stars IMO is the dated casino (compared to others) and a couple of bad dining spots (Kahunaville and the buffet) - see my reviews on those.	5	4	-1	4	4	5	-1	5

TI is in the mist of all the action in Vegas and everything was close by and walking distance. The Walgreens across the road was really handy! The show that TI put on everynight was one of the best shows you will see! The internet was a bit annoying sometimes it would kick you out and you would have to call up for a code. <br/>Our toilet got blocked one night and we rang the reception and the man came up to fix it in literally 1 minute.. They wer very quick to answer all your needs like extra towels, pillows etc.<br/>They dont have a bottle opener in the room! You have to pay $5 for someone to come upto your room and open your bottles which is really my only issue with the hotel! Everything else was fabulous and would stay there again in no time!	5	5	-1	5	4	5	-1	5

I liked how it attaches to the Fashion Mall which was very convenient. The rooms were quite nice and clean. Had a beautiful view of the strip which is worth the extra money. The Vietnemese restaurant downstairs has great food Although service was quite slow. I think this hotel has great value for the money as the location is pretty good and the hotel is pretty clean and is kind of mid range. I would stay here again.	4	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	5

When we arrived on Friday night, there was a very long line to check in but it moved pretty quickly. We found our room on the 35th floor, and I was slightly disappointed that we did not overlook the front of the hotel where the Siren show is performed, but we actually preferred and loved our view of the beautiful pool and the Strip and surrounding area. We tried to connect to the internet, then were uncertain about the $17.99 internet fee that popped up (per laptop) because we were told that wi-fi was included in our resort fee. We asked the staff, who clarified that internet was included and no extra charges would be applied to our account so we were safe to continue connecting. After we settled into our room, we decided to try the buffet for dinner. There were a lot of choices! The prime rib was very tender and the whipped sweet potatoes were delicious! We were surprised at the variety of desserts, including mini donuts, cupcakes, and freshly made cotton candy! After dinner, we proceeded to the Casino to join the players club and play some games. The casino was clean, the staff was friendly and helpful. When it was time to head back to the room, we were asked to show our room key before boarding the elevators, which I thought was a nice security feature. One thing we noticed and appreciated was the room did not smell like stale smoke. The room and bathroom were spacious with a nice sized closet. Inside the closet was a small safe and a mini- refrigerator, which was nice for keeping some extra bottles of water cold! The linens were clean and the beds had extra pillows that were soft and fluffy. And what can i say about the beds? They were amazingly soft and comfortable! I wish my bed at home was that comfortable. We slept great both nights of our stay. On Saturday, we watched the Sirens show in front of the hotel. There was quite a crowd, and then we found the hotel guest viewing area and we had a good spot to watch the show, which was fun and the special effects were good. The staff were friendly and helpful. I have no complaints, other than maybe housekeeping should dust the bathroom vent (it had a thick layer of dust). The room was as good as we expected for the price, and we would go back for another stay!	4	5	-1	5	4	5	-1	5

I found the staff, both front desk and in the dining areas unresponsive and nobody looked like they even remotely enjoyed their jobs or displayed any people skills whatsoever, maybe the high turnover of guest has created this &quot;Stepford&quot; like attitude. Though I had breakfast included in my rate, I was denied and turned away from the breakfast buffet because it was Easter. This exception should have been explained beforehand. NO ONE aplogized for this inconvenience. This place is in serious need of a complete overhaul! I would dread the prospect of having to stay there again, if your into riding a mechanical bull, then this is the place for you, but with all the choices out there...I'd go elsewhere	2	3	-1	2	1	2	-1	3

I went to Vegas on my own which is a lonely thing to do, so choosing the right hotel is very important. This is located down the far end of the strip so you actually feel like you have a little peace, but are still on the strip. The proximity to Ceasars and the Bellagio was perfect. The non strip side of the hotel is great too as it has mountain views across Vegas and is very very quiet. The room was big enough but cleaning could have been a little more detailed. I found the restaurants to be reasonable, but preferred to eat out. The only problem was the 1.5 hour check in wait. I nearly left because I had just flown in from Australia and just needed my room. However I hear a lot of hotels in Vegas do not manage check in well, so might be best to research other hotels to see who does it well if you want to get in quick.	5	5	-1	3	3	3	-1	4

Our kids are 6, 9, and 11 so it's not like they used any of the &quot;Resort Fee&quot; perks. Actually, we didn't either...at all. So, we would have stayed at another hotel had we realized this before we booked our trip. The hotel is great. It's clean, the pillows and beds are very comfortable, we couldn't hear the neighbors, and we were able to get the requested rooms...strip/Sirens show view and adjoining rooms on the 33rd floor....if you like silence the strip view rooms are not for you! The Sirens show and the cop sirens are LOUD all night long. All of the employees were nice. Pool was really a party scene and the kids liked it. The drinks were crazy expensive...the 3 kids got 3 n/a strawberry daquiries for $30-ouch. The slots were not as loose as other casinos but the tables were great! The restaurants are decent. We won't stay here again but don't let that stop you from enjoying TI, it really was a fun stay and we liked it and the location is good too.	3	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

We usually stay at Planet Hollywood when we go to Las Vegas, but we got a package deal through the airline that seemed reasonable. However, when we went to check in, we were informed there would be a &quot;resort fee&quot; of $28 added to each day of our stay. That amounted to an extra $84. We could have stayed at Planet Hollywood for less (they do not charge a resort fee, rooms and bathrooms are much bigger); we were very disappointed. Rooms were really clean and updated. Nice beds and pillows. Bathroom was a little small, with very poor lighting which makes it really hard to put on make up or do your hair. There's a large opening under the door that lets in a lot of the hallway light at night. Staff at check in was nice; staff at check out was curt with an attitude. Pool area is pretty and tropical, but noisy. Planet Hollywood has two separate pools: one for adults; one for families, so it's much quieter. All in all, we wouldn't stay here again, if only because they charge a resort fee.	3	3	-1	3	4	3	-1	3

Our room was on the 23rd floor, towards the far end near the exit stairs. It was nice and comfortable room with all the amenities. The view of the strip from our room window was just amazing, we could see the full strip. That view made the entire stay worthwhile. The location of TI on the strip is just amazing, it is on the strip yet not that maddening. The casino is also nice. The hotel itself is very nice. <br/>The staff at the reception was nice and helpful. We found this place a good decent deal worth the money spent.

My wife and I stayed at Treasure Island from April 2nd to the 7th 2012 room # 19085. We were very much looking forward to our second trip to Vegas. After a couple hours of research and reading reviews we chose Treasure Island as the hotel to stay in. <br/> <br/>Over all we liked TI a lot. The staff was friendly, the Casino was great, and the buffet was wonderful. After checking in we went to our room. The room was a good size, great view and the most comfortable beds I've been in in any hotel.<br/> <br/>That being said in our room one of the dresser drawers was hanging or broken off barely attached not looking that good, it was late we just got to Vegas we would handle it in the morning. The dresser drawer was fixed the next day when I phoned down to the front desk to lodge a TV problem complaint along with our broken drawer. We hit the strip and both were fixed. The drawer not for long it needs to be jammed to close. <br/> <br/>On the 3rd we spoke to the maid told her our room was ok except if the garbage could please be removed. After we got back from the strip the garbage was not removed that day at all. On the 4th my wife was going to the washroom pulled on the toilet paper roll and the whole bracket falls off the wall, this happens a few times over our stay. After my one shower I had I determined the wheel in/or handicap shower was not usable. The bracket that the shower head ran up and down on was no longer attached to the wall at the bottom. It moved revealing a two inch rusted screw sticking out of the wall. During the one shower I was able to take I scratched my arm on the screw.<br/> <br/>The cleanliness of our bathroom was horrible. I'm sure the shower walls were not cleaned but simply hosed down. During my shower I'm forced because of the bench angle to lean against the wall for support. After my shower I developed a rash all across my shoulder blades where I was leaning on the wall, on my scraped arm from the rusted screw, and the bottom of my feet. My wife was concerned enough to take pictures.<br/>We asked for clean towels in our room on the 5th. What we got were gray unclean looking towels that my wife compared to worn out ones we keep in the bottom of our rag closet.<br/> <br/>I realize with so many rooms it must be hard to keep track of every room. Not sure if you have staff or if its housekeeping responsibility to report room repairs. The Treasure Island handicap room was the only let down on our vacation! I think another hotel is in order for next time(to bad I like the casino)<br/> <br/><br/>Mike McMullan	3	4	-1	4	1	4	-1	5

Everyday you stay, add another $28. Here is the catch; they say you get a newspaper every day; which you have to go down to the front desk in the lobby to get everyday yourself. The buy one get one free buffet; you only get one for your whole stay. So say you are staying a week, you only get one coupon for the whole week. Also, you only get one $20 credit for a future stay, not one coupon per day. You also get to print your boarding pass for free with the resort fee. Umm what happens if you drove from another state?<br/>2. Smoking in the room areas: Treasure Island has signs everywhere saying smoking is not permitted other than in the casino itself. Unfortunately, these signs are only in English and not in other languages for foreign guests. Which means some guests smoked in the halls and meeting areas of hotel floors where the rooms were. I don?? know about other rooms, my room leaked around the doors which let in the cigarette and cigar smoke. I had to soak towels and put them at the base of the doors as to block out the cigarette and cigar smoke. <br/>3. Buffets: Wow, I remember the days when buffets were dirt cheap to attracted people. Now these days, buffets at the Treasure Island are $17.00 for breakfast to $24.00 for dinner. The only good thing about the buffet was the dessert bar, omelet station and salad station. Very over priced buffet. I spent an extra $3.00 and went to the Mirage buffet and it was great. Triple the size of Treasure Island buffet. But there dessert options were small compared to Treasure Island. If you go to the Mirage, there is a free tram from Treasure Island to the Mirage. <br/>4. Plumbing: I don?? know about the other rooms, but the plumbing in our room was interesting. We had a petite suite which luckily had two bathrooms. The one bathroom, the sink did not drain, you would have to wait a while if too much water filled the sink. We left for dinner one night and we came back and found black ash from smokers or sand at the bottom of the sink to make me think maybe the drain backed up. <br/>5. Casino Size: I don?? know if I missed a room but the casino size for gaming tables and slot machines did not give you a big variety compared to the Venetian or Mirage. <br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>1. View: we got a petite suite on the 28th floor. It was a nice view of the mountains and Trump?? casino. <br/>2. Location: The location was good. We were next door to the Fashion Mall where there were places to shop and eat at if you didn?? feel like paying the high cost of buffets. Plus there was a store to buy shows tickets at a cheaper price. Also for the location, it is across the street from the Palazzo and Venetian. <br/>3. Room: Other than the pluming problems, it was nice to have two bathrooms; one with a whirlpool and the other bathroom with a full shower. Each bathroom had a closet which is good for his and hers. <br/>4. Employees: The employees were cordial and respectful. They seem to like working there. <br/><br/>Summary:<br/><br/>It is an okay place to stay. You got the $25 resort fee which I call the $28 gotcha fee which reminds me of the baggage fees some airlines have. The buffets; I would go to Mirage if you do not want to go far or save money at the mall for name brand restaurants that are there; John Rockets, Nathan?? Famous Hotdog, California Pizza Kitchen, Maggianos, etc. The room was nice expect for plumbing issues. Employees from cordial and helpful.	3	4	-1	4	3	4	-1	3

This was my first time booking a hotel so I didn't really know what to expect. <br/><br/>Let me start with the best things about Treasure Island: <br/>-The beds are incredibly comfortable! I didn't have any problem getting a good night's sleep.<br/>-The pool area had padded flooring which made it comfortable walking around barefoot.<br/>-There was also a DJ at the pool during the Monday I was there but not the following day. It definitely livened up the mood with my friends and myself.<br/>-The resort itself is in a great location.... There is a Chipotle, 24 hour Starbucks, and a shopping mall all within walking distance.<br/><br/>Here's some of the bad things about the hotel:<br/>-The $25 resort fee. I was staying for 2 nights so it was ridiculous that I was being charged this month for some services I wasn't going to use. The &quot;free&quot; wifi was the only thing I liked about it.<br/>-The room I was staying in had a hole in the wall behind the door. Luckily I did a walkthrough of my room once I got there and notified the staff. The hole was never fixed though.<br/>-Housekeeping recycled used towels from the previous stay and just folded them to look nice. I found blood and hair on one of the washcloths.<br/>-Housekeeping threw away a TI shop bag with a souvenir shot glass that a friend had bought.<br/><br/>Overall, I had a fairly decent time at TI. My friends didn't really have too many complaints and we were able to enjoy ourselves for the most part.	3	5	-1	3	3	3	-1	5

Treasure Island is just ok, we stayed there as part of a package so it wasn't that expensive but it's not that amazing. It seems a bit old and dated and a bit tacky, but then again is Vegas... <br/><br/>The pool is on the smaller side and was packed at all times, food was ok, rooms were big and clean. <br/><br/>So my recommendation is keep looking around and if you find a better deal, take it.	3	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	4

I explained that I would have no time to take advantage of the resort amenities but that didn't matter to them. I'm sure that &quot;RESORT FEE&quot; was hidden somewhere in the fine print of the online travel site that I used to book the room, but IT SHOULD BE LISTED IN THE ACTUAL ROOM PRICE!!! This is not an optional fee. Beware. I am staying elsewhere during subsequent trips to Vegas until they stop using these underhanded tactics. I advise you to do the same.	1	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

There wasn't anything particularily stellar about TI. The lobby and main interior is contemporary but not lavish. The hallways are clean and modern.<br/><br/>Cons 1. Resort fee: $28 a day .$25 + $3 tax (12% state tax). Everyday you stay, add another $28. 2. Wifi service was terribly slow. 3. Dinner buffets: Food options at &quot;The Buffet&quot; were limited and not much better than what you would see at a Hometown Buffet; Below average. The only good thing about the dinner buffet was the dessert bar. The dessert options were great for me; small and pretty tasty. I had a mini fruit tart, mini creme brule, and a mini eclair. The omelet maker was very effecient and attentive. 4. Sirens of the TI: 2 nights in a row the evening show was cancelled - Glad I did not opt for the &quot;Pirate show room view&quot; that I was offered. <br/><br/>Pros: 1. View: Standard 24th floor room. We were able to countdown and see the mirage volcano and bellagio fountain shows. Such a thrill for our little ones. 2. Location: The location was ideal. Virtually the middle of the strip. Great people watching and close to most vegas attractions. Next to the Fashion Mall were places to shop and eat if you wanted lower cost options than the buffets. TI is across the street from the Palazzo and Venetian (my favorite). 3. Service: Employees were pleasant and cordial. 4. Breakfast buffet: The breakfast options were great. Flavorful coffee and I enjoyed the waffles. Finally, the omelet station was outstanding. The omelet maker was very effecient and attentive.	3	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

Waited 40 minutes in the line for check in and thankfully our room was ready (thank god). Got given 2 for 1 cocktails which are false advertising as you can only have drinks up to the value of $9 which no cocktails were. Bartenders at the tequila bar were also extremely rude and would not accept my Australian drivers license? Got charged $160 for a few phone calls INSIDE America. Most were in state and only 2 actually connected and spoke to the person on the other line for no longer than 2 minutes..what a joke. <br/>Tried to speak to the manager on duty and he was no help. So disappointed my holiday turned into a nightmare and a very expensive one once you add up the $200 room fee plus resort fee at $28 per day AND $160 phone bill. Will never recommend this hotel to anyone. Why stay here when you can spend less and have a better, brand new room down the road at MGM and actually get fantastic customer service?<br/>TI gets two thumbs down from me.	1	1	-1	3	3	1	-1	3

You're paying for nothing other than location. We'd have been happier to stay at a standard hotel somewhere else in the city.	1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1

We were charged an additional $20 at check in for the resort fee (which has gone up a few more dollars since then I understand). That hurt since we didn't use the pool, gym or much else associated with the fee, but the amazingly low rate means it did not lose a star.<br/><br/>I'd read that it's smokey, and since I have asthma I was concerned, but never had a problem. <br/><br/>Room was very nice and has an EMPTY FRIDGE! So bring waters and whatever else you want, it will save you money. I called and asked housekeeping to make up our room between 11a-1pm and when we got back at 2pm the room was done. <br/><br/>We were upgraded for free when they learned it was our 10 year anniversary. We had a corner room on the 15th floor with TWO views, one of the pool and one of the strip, very very nice and very quiet (except for the occasional high wind outside).<br/><br/>We had their buffet, used our 2 for 1 coupon (part of the resort fee). I have to say, it was just ok. I would NEVER pay their full rate for that buffet, but it's worth the 2 for 1. We went for breakfast and it was standard fare, the omelet was particually good.<br/><br/>Check in was not bad, we waited about 20 minutes, checked in at 2pm so at a very popular time.<br/><br/>If you gamble the BEST SLOT GAME in vegas is right in this hotel. Just past the enterence for Gillies, against a wall you'll see a fishing game- it's huge, 6 seats across with a big screen on top. It's soooo much fun! You play against up to 5 other people and get to have fishing contests etc. It's 1 cent minimum, but in reality you need to play about 30 cents every 10 seconds to keep in the contest. The first time we played, on Thursday night, we put in $5 and ended up walking away with $60 (it had gone up much higher but we were having too much fun) We played it twice more and just walked away with our original money after going up and down but were highly entertained.<br/><br/>TI is a GREAT location. Although we had a car we left it in self park for the 3 nights and walked EVERYWHERE, sometimes up to 15 miles a day (I was wearing a pediomator) to make up for all the huge meals we were eating. We walked as far as Circus Circus on one end all the way to Mandalay Bay on the other, so if you want to see the strip, this is a great hotel to do it from.<br/><br/>About Sirens of Ti, the first two nights it did not run because of high winds, but they were not telling anyone standing around that it wasn't going on. We noticed the winds and asked and were told it was a 99% chance they were not going to run it, so I don't get why they wouldn't let everyone know? The last night the show went on, but honestly, unless you happen to be there and don't wait long it's really not worth your time, and it is definitely NOT for children. I learned afterwards that one of my cousin's play one of the pirates, but it would still not want to make me go see it again. FYI, if you stay at the hotel, you can go just a bit before and stand in the VIP section after showing your room key.<br/><br/>So overall, I recommend TI if you get a good room rate, since you'll have to tack on $20 plus per night after you get there.	5	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	5

Having Walgreens right across the street was super convienent. And Tao was right there as well as the cool volcano at the Mirage and several restaurants. And the Fashion Mall!!! It was our 1st trip and it was the funnest weekend ever. Will deff stay there again. Beds were super comfy too :) My only complaint was that I didn't hear anything about a resort fee until check in.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

I took a cab from Airport and cab took me around 20 min to reach and charged 25 dollars. You have other choices as well. It s Located at the strip.<br/><br/>I understand being Friday it would be little more crowdy but to my experience it was.much more than that it tool me plus 30 min in a que and couple of minutes for xheck in. As they do not have enough people to take care of more volume.<br/><br/>Any how I asked if I can have a rescheduling done due to some other work they simply denied as said.would either case charge for all three nights. So little inflexiblity.<br/><br/>The location is near starbucks opposite to wal greens so you can move around a bit for some of goodies.<br/><br/>Cost of room started with usd 120 but they charge you fix resort fees 25 usd for what services I did not understood as whatever it is its a service of anyhotel like free internet etc.<br/><br/>They have Bar Casino downstairs. And good place for fooding etc. I dont think this hotel has much to offer what others cannot. Heard a lot about Pirate show but to my utter surprise if you are staying below.nine or 12 floor with west tower you would not even see anything. So better asked for a room which provides clear view<br/><br/>Rest are same as usual. Some areas are good and some.extrrmely bad.<br/><br/>Casino is good but seems old machines and I can assure you that you would loose money on slots.<br/><br/>Well everybody looses at every place.<br/><br/>If you are at new at some game ask for help and they would help you. I did not got 10 usd player start up or even my points could not be used for playing. Stupid dumb machines<br/><br/><br/>	3	3	-1	3	4	2	-1	-1

Very Happy!	5	3	We just got back from four days at Treasure Island and I was 100% satisfied. I work in the hospitality industry and can be a little picky about housekeeping and other little things, but Treasure Island was perfect. The room service, while a little pricey, was excellent! My husband got a steak at 2am and said it was one of the best he had ever had. The staff was also wonderful at check in and while they did their best to give us exactly what we wanted (a King, smoking) we ended up with a 2 queen, smoking but on the penthouse level! We ended up on the very top floor with the most amazing view. It was room 36024 and we had a perfect view of the Mirage volcano eruption too! I also only paid like $80 a night for this room so I was extremely satisfied. Also perfect location on the strip, just a very short walk to several other casinos and a Walgreens. Beds were also super comfortable and everything was in excellent condition and very clean.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

The bed was awful, probably one of the worst i've ever slept in, both mine and my wife's sides were dented in with a ridge in the middle, and lumpy all over,my back still hurts, definitly needs new mattresses, thank god for the jetted tub. The room was supposed to come with an Ipod dock station which It did not have, but to give them credit when I called and asked about it they sent one up. Over all the hotel and casino is ok, but there is alot to improve on, the buffet was not up to par, the service there sucked, we asked for ketchup 3 times before we got some only to have the waitress take it off our table(without asking if we were done) to give it to another table, then she did the same thing to them, 1 ketchup bottle for the section, give me a break. Canter's deli was really good, the cafe was just o.k. The same food they serve as room service. The $10-100 free slot play they say they give you with your resort fee was a joke. We asked for a later check out time by an hour or 2 but they said no the hotel was sold out, then they proceeded to tell me that i could pay a $160.00 for another night. (I thought they were sold out?) good location, good atmosphere but just seemed liked they try to nickel and dime you for everything. Customer service is lacking compared to some of the other hotels. Could have easily been given 3-4 stars if it wasn't for the bad bed, the resort fee and the way they handled the late check out. (1-2 hours come on)	2	4	-1	3	3	2	-1	1

It was the closest hotel in a reasonable price. From the photos and the look on the lobby I was expecting and old hotel feel, but to my surprise when i got to the hallways and room its was very modern, clean and comfortable. The lobby had the starbucks and crispy creme I needed. It also had a few good restaurant and bars. The walgreens was just at the other side of the street and there was a shopping center very close. Also I think its a good location within the street, as it was almost in the middle of all the hotels and restaurants. I think it is one of the best price-value options considering all this!	5	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

Treasure Island quoted a decent rate and they were on the strip. But when we went to check-in, they said that in addition to the room charge they had quoted over the phone, we also had to pay an additional $25 &quot;Mandatory Resort Fee&quot; per room. They said that all the other hotels on the strip did the same thing. By then we'd parked the car and unloaded the luggage, so we stayed anyway. <br/><br/>First, when you ask for a rate on a room, and you leave off a mandatory charge, that just isn't being honest. And as for all the hotels on the strip doing it, we saw at least two others who were advertising that they don't apply mandatory fees. One advertisement said, &quot;Mandatory and Las Vegas don't go together.&quot; Some of the stars that do shows are even protesting against it. See http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2011/07/22/marie_osmond_joins_las_vegas_mandatory<br/><br/>It's a shame, because otherwise the place wasn't bad. But I don't do repeat business with dishonest companies.	3	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

Check in was easy - only person in line... same with check out. Found the elevators pretty quickly - if I had my kids with me I wouldn't particularly want to walk through the casino to get to the elevators... but that's Vegas! Elevators were always quick and our floor (32nd) was quiet - never heard anyone - we seen people so I know we weren't the only ones up there - lol! We dont drink coffee but I did notice that there were no coffee makers - did see a blow dryer and an iron in the closet - room was updated, clean and did not smell of smoke at all... nice view.. spent some time by the pool and was really good.

My fiance &amp; I stayed there for a week in late September 2011 from Sunday to Saturday. We had an early morning flight &amp; arrived at the hotel around 11. <br/>The line to check in was slightly long but we were able to get into our room right away - a huge plus when all you want to do is put your stuff away and get outside to explore! <br/><br/>I had reserved us a pool cabana for our 3rd day in advance - I can't say enough about the wonderful service we had at the pool that day. We felt like royalty. Don't get me wrong...for the price you pay, you should, but they really do take super great care of you. <br/><br/>LOVED LOVED LOVED the food at Kahunaville &amp; the Coffee Shop's breakfast!<br/><br/>We also ate at the steak house (it was ok. hated that they had photographers hunting you down during your dinner to sell you photos) and had the buffet once (or twice?) and it was good. <br/><br/>My only complaint, and this is not about the resort, is that the car rental company we used had a booth there and the lines were painfully long &amp; slow.<br/><br/>Though I know we will stay at other resorts during future Vegas trips, I have no doubt we'd go back to Treasure Island in a heartbeat.	4	5	-1	5	4	4	-1	4

We really enjoyed the tub, there is a bath soap store in mandalay bay shops that have great bubble bath bombs. We never had time to visit much of the hotel or its bufett. The lobby and casino is smoky, we went to the circque show the O, and the phatom of the opera. Ate at delmonicos and le cirque and le fluer. Pretty nice place to stay for the money.	5	5	-1	5	4	4	-1	4

I booked one night at Treasure Island so that I could say that I had stayed on the Vegas Strip. Like so many others have said, Vegas is not the travel bargan it was a few years ago. Every thing on the strip is expensive now. I enjoyed the Vegas atmosphere, the Pirate show out in front of the Hotel, the Dancing Waters down the street at the Bellagio down the street, and most of all watching the crazy people that walk up and down the Vegas Strip. TI is a nice hotel, and I would stay there again. Beds were comfortable, room was average size, average decore. Buffett was above average, but pricey if you do not use the 2 for 1 coupon that is in the welcome pack. I was a bit agravated at the &quot;Resort Fee&quot; that was supposed to cover all of the amentities that were available - when I was only staying one night and leaving early the next day. I had no chance to take advantage of the bells and whistles the resort has, and they would not waive the fee. (I guess the &quot;Free Pirate Show&quot; cost me 20 bucks.) <br/><br/>Joe	3	5	-1	3	4	3	-1	4

The hotel service was excellent. Check-in was a breeze and we got a room on the 26th floor facing the strip: great view. We were short a few towels and had no problem getting what we needed for the four of us. Guest services was also helpful and assistance was spontaneously offered by other staff while I was waiting for my husband. The kids were disappointed that the pool closed so early, only open from 9am to 6pm. Furnishings were contemporary. Linens were clean and looked sharp. Beds were comfortable. I only rated a 3/5 on cleanliness because the carpets could have been much cleaner with an even line of dust on the carpet around the baseboards; I wore my special hotel flip flops in the room. The bathroom was very clean. I agree with b_oregon1984, it is a bit expensive for family meals but it's the old addage, location, location, location. Rooms off the strip can be had for much less. Meals for the family can add up as he noted, breakfast buffet is $18pp, dinner about 23pp if I remember correctly. We had breakfast at the Coffee Shop and a little sticker shock, but the portions were huge so not bad value if you're hungry. We had the dinner buffet and it was excellent and very good value.	3	5	-1	4	3	5	-1	4

Gym is good too, with one exception see below. Casin and bars were ok, and we had a blast seeing Mystere! Great show. <br/>Things I would Change: Hotel does not offer the authorized government rate, s'mon get with the program. I stayed at Caesars last year for exact GOV Rate. I got a 10% discount which was very nice, but other hotels gave up rooms for gov rate. Also, read the fine print on the &quot;Resort Fee&quot;! It gives you access to the gym, BUT NOT THE SAUNA, STEAM RM etc. An additional 17 bucks per day. Weak. Make it inclusive. I will see about staying here next time given these factors.	3	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

We'd booked a strip view room at TI Treasure Island Hotel and Casino. This was our first time to Las Vegas and didn't really know what to expect. <br/><br/>Arrival and Registration<br/>We drove to the hotel so when we arrived at the entrance is was a bit of car chaos. People unloading everywhere, valets shouting at each other, families and couples dragging their items to the sidewalk, and bell boys racing around with suitcase carriers. It was nutty! Once we parked the car and entered the hotel, I was immediately aware that the air was perfumed and found it quite stifling. Upon arrival at the front desk, we proceeded to line up with all the other new arrivals. We received our keys and vouchers and were given a strip view room on the 15th floor. Note that there is a $25US facilities fee a night here - for what I'm not quite sure. We then walked through the casino to the elevators and ascended to our room.<br/><br/>Room<br/>Upon entry, the room was average sized but had a lovely view of the strip. It was very clean and nicely decorated and smelled fresh. The bathroom had a deep bath tub, and a large counter and an assortment of toiletries. There was a king bed, a lounge chair and wall unit/vanity/desk. There was no coffee maker, water or any additionals. There was also a smaller flat screen. Wifi was about $10 for 4 hours, $15 for 8 hours and $20 for 24 hours I think. We were across from the ice machine and vending machine where a bottle of Sprite was $3. For our entire stay the room was an excellent retreat from the action below us and never once did our floor smell perfumed or smokey and it was very quiet at night. The view at night was lovely with all of the lights from other casinos like the Flamingo, Harras, The Mirage and more, and we could watch the fire show from the Mirage.<br/><br/>Vouchers<br/>We didn't use any of our vouchers for breakfast or dinner as each time we went to the restaurant there were about 75 people in line.<br/><br/>Treasure Island Casino<br/>We're not gamblers but we found penny slots, 5 cent slots, 25 cent slots and up. We played some, and servers would come around once in a while with free drinks as long as you were gambling. We also tried Black Jack which was exciting and the dealers, although stern, were helpful in explaining the rules of the game. <br/><br/>Pool and Hotel Grounds<br/>The hotel grounds are surrounded with palms and there is a medium sized pool and hot tub with lounge chairs and cabanas. The weather was chilly while there so we didn't swim.<br/><br/>Location<br/>The hotel seems to be in a strategic location to access the Fashion Show Mall and walking up and down the strip. There is a Cirque Du Soleil show in the hotel and a whole bunch of shops. There is also the Sirens show on the pirate ship which is apparently good - we didn't catch it.<br/><br/>Overall, although accommodations met all of our needs, I never felt like a guest, but more like a debit machine. I guess that's the way it is in such a huge facility but I think a hotel where you are made to feel special is more my speed. We did get a decent room rate for our stay so I can't complain but I don't think I'll be back. If I ever visit Las Vegas again, I would pay more for a touch more client service where you as a guest feel valuable and that you leave feeling like your experience there mattered.	3	4	-1	3	5	2	-1	-1

The reception staff at check-in is so inadequately trained that when you called front desk you get 10 different answers!!!!! The last day of our stay we had a late flight and wanted to pay for a 1/2 day rate or late check out. When I called in the morning I never got a straight answer from anyone. I was told there were no such thing as a 1/2 day rate or late checkout ( which last time stayed at hotel they offered it ??) so I called back then got quoted different rates that were ridiculously priced! They were so rude the staff I was shocked. I called back again and wanted to speak to supervisor who was also rude and he quoted me yet another price! I said it was cheaper to book a whole night on Expedia he said go right ahead! I called again knowing I'd get a different answer and decided to pay the $80 to stay till 5 pm in room(ridiculous) I finally lost it when they made me go to the front desk and being my visa down.....my visa is already on file hello????

One last note don't eat at the Buffett it was most horrible food I had ever eaten in my life..... Go figure this was the only thing free as we received from the hotel.	3	5	-1	3	3	1	-1	-1

Get to our room and it was dirty so they had to reclean it. The one good thing is the free wifi that is covered with the resort fee. On our last day call for a late check out and once again nope sold out, but friends with the suite got a late check out. Not sure if they just cater to the people with suites or not. The rooms are getting very dated and in need of an upgrade. ?Another bonus was the free tram to the Mirage which is a nicer hotel. ?Over all we were not happy with this hotel.	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1

We had a petite suite and loved having the extra space. We booked the room only after signing their online guestbook. This allowed us special pricing for our first visit. We got the petite suite cheaper than if we had just booked a regular room without signing up. We found the room very clean - no issues with dirt as some guests have reported. It was lovely having the two bathrooms, one with a jet tub for two and the other with a nice walk in shower. Sure it's not the Belagio but you're not paying the same kind of money either. We checked in about 2 AM and even then there was a line up to check in but the line moved very quickly. We were in our room within 20 minutes. The location of this hotel was really great. Right in the middle of everything. The Walgreens right across the street was very handy for some forgotten items. We ate at the buffet one evening - used our coupon. We really enjoyed it. We ate at the Kahunaville a couple of times, once for breakfast and once for lunch. The food was average, not specatular but good solid bar food. Ate at Gilly's for a very late dinner one night. Again the food was ok - not great. We had a car rental and the parking area is fantastic Plenty of space to park and free. Overall we really enjoyed our stay there and wouldn't hesitate to book it again.	4	5	-1	4	4	3	-1	4

Hair dryer Iron and board in the room digital safe too. Lots of offers in welcome pack like 2 breakfasts or lunches reduced price and some half price the buffet champayne breakfast was lovely you could go back as often as you liked lunch on last day was great set us up for journey back to uk. You can smoke in the casinos tip the waitresses a few dollers and get free drinks when you are playing. 10 Min walk to shopping mall cheap places to eat Wendys KFC etc they all do breakfast too. Mcdonalds not far, Was not sure what clothes to bring but really anything goes smart casual or just shorts. Lovely swimming pool with lots of sun beds towels provided, lovely warm pool again waitress service and snacks avaiable. Free tram in the hotel that brings you to The Mirage Hotel takes few mins runs till quite late. Excellent place to be so near to everything, go to all the hotels they are all amazing, Booked through Expedia and used the Bell transport could not fault pick up and drop off just tipped the driver. Resort fee payable on arrival $22 per night if there are a few of you you can split it you can use the internet if you bring your laptop free and local calls from the room, Got a calling card to phone UK $20 used quite a few times. <br/>Just read some other reviews we never asked for an upgrade and were happy with our room cleaned everyday lovely white clean sheets 2 large queen size beds, checked in no problem check out a few people before us but plenty of reception staff, All staff were helpfull.<br/>There is a volcano shoe outside the Mirage in the evening, Pirate show outside Treasure Island all free to watch and dont forget the water fountains dancing to music at the Balacio got tickets for Donny &amp; Marie Osmond so dissapointed on our last night that the show was cancelled as he was not well got our money back. You can go into any of the hotels and Ceasers Palace was amazing. Stay on the strip we were advised not to walk in the back streets we had no problems and never felt uneasy 2 women on holiday, Only strange thing you never really saw the same person twice there were so many people coming and going day and night.<br/>A few shops in our hotel tom &amp; gerry icecream pizza starbucks etc you can bring starbucks drinks to the pool but not bottled water they take it off you but there is a free water machine with plastic cups.<br/>Rouleete tables quite expensive $15 per chip try the roulette machines $3 for a few goes won quite a lot on them.<br/>At the airport a few machines my friend won $300 not many shops quite a small airport very small duty free, Had a great time would go back to this hotel and highly recommend it bring comfortable shoes of flip flops quite a lot of walking. Weather in march was lovely we came back 16th and apparently weather changed for the worse , air con and heating in our room wedding chapel on the 31st floor we stayed on the 32nd floor.<br/>Have a great time and enjoy the experience like a grown up Disney land.<br/>Hope the review was of some help to whoever reads it.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Our room is a double queen with a strip view on the 24th floor. I would have preferred a single king strip view but we checked in late and there were no more non-smoking available. If I wasn't absolutely exhausted last night when we checked in, I might have looked in to staying elsewhere. This is my first trip to Vegas so the guy who checked us in &quot;comped me the $15 dollar up charge for the strip view room&quot;. Nice gesture but I'm not overly impressed. There are numerous other hotels to choose from so I probably won't be staying here again.	3	4	-1	4	3	5	-1	4

Our room at TI (king bed, highway-facing, booked as part of a Southwest Airlines vacation package with airfare) scored high marks in all those categories. The room was everything it needed to be for just the right price, leaving us rested (with money to squander) and ready to experience Vegas.<br/><br/>I think Treasure Island is a good home base. The pool scene was pretty spring break-ish, but you can find a quiet corner if that's more your taste. We had no problem getting everywhere we needed to go on The Strip either on foot or via taxi. TI's casino seemed smokier than its counterparts at different properties, and their automatic $20/night fee for WiFi, gym access, and other amenities was pretty absurd. I didn't appreciate having to pay for things I was never going to use.	4	5	-1	5	4	4	-1	5

This time they gave me a comped suite for 3 nights and several hundred in free play. I have always loved TI as far as location and selection of machines to play. Very clean rooms and staff is very nice to me.<br/><br/>We also say Mystere which is an excellent show and seats are all good. I prefer a little higher so as not to stretch your neck looking up.<br/><br/>ONE NOTEWORTHY ITEM: Upon check out I had two internet charges of 17.95 each for the two days.<br/>Since we did not bring our laptops I questioned this. He said you must have sent e-mails from your phones-I said no we did not. We did however, READ an incoming text message each day. We did NOT answer the text. So 17.95 per day to read one text each day?????? We were appalled. So here it is--DO NOT READ A TEXT MESSAGE IN YOUR ROOM-TI WILL CAPTURE THE SIGNAL AND CHARGE YOU THROUGH THE NOSE. DO NOT SEND ONE EITHER. DO NOT READ YOUR PHONE E-MAIL IN YOUR ROOM. GO TO THE LOBBY OR SOMEWHERE ELSE. I THINK THAT IS CHICKEN XXXX TO CHARGE FOR READING A TEXT ON YOUR PHONE, DON'T YOU?? SO $36 BUCKS TO READ TWO TEXT MESSAGES? I am sure the fine print says this somewhere upon check in, but I and my wife were unaware. Well we know now. Lesson learned.<br/><br/>We lost a lot of dough on this trip, so this little gem upon check out was not taken well.<br/>Nevertheless, we love TI and should be back this year sometime.<br/><br/>Big Jim	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

We decided to stay at TI. The casino is very old and smell of twenty year old smoke lingered throughout the casino. Mystere was a very enjoyable experience for 1st time Cirque du Soliel goers. The rooms were very clean and comfortable, but basic. The pool area was very reminscient of 33 year olds on Spring Break. Very small, overcrowded, &amp; old. Thankfully, they continued to give coupons for BOGO girilie drinks at Kauhnaville. And the pirate show was absolutely terrible.<br/><br/>Lastly, the check-in line was slowest I have ever seen.

Having previously stayed at Circu Circus and Luxor we wanted something different.<br/>I must say our choice to stay here was based not only on value , but also on location !<br/>With regards to location it was superb - middle of The Strip , so handy for everything. <br/>With regards to the room ? .... it was ok , but thats about it ! Bit boring ... we had a Tower Room - on a high floor which meant that the view was great but form the first day there was a problem with a leaking airco in the bedroom itslef. This meant we had a bad smell all the time - a sort of rotting .... i guess from the carpet.<br/>We complained but werent able to be moved !!!!!!!! Every day ( we stayed 4 nights ) we were told that it would be sorted but it wasnt. On check-out they took off the resort fee ... but tried to charge us for breakfast ( we had an expedia b'fast incl. deal ). Eventually we had to pay for the few days and got the money refunded from Expedia !<br/>This really affected our stay and has deffinately meant that we WONT be going back there again !<br/>Shame .... it could have been so much better !	3	4	-1	2	1	3	-1	2

Fortunately I was meeting family, so I stored my luggage in their room. I called the front desk over the next three hours and each time I was told the line was still very long. We went out to dinner and when we got back I joined the line at around 7:00 PM. It still took me an hour to check in. There were only four staff members working and they showed absolutely no sense of urgency in taking care of the guests. When I finally made it to the desk, the girl who checked me in seemed bored. I asked a few questions about the property and received monosyllable answers. She never once made eye contact with me. The rest of the stay was fine, but you would think they could do a better job with check-in. I have stayed at many properties on the Strip over the years and never run into this situation before.	3	4	-1	4	4	1	-1	4

Room was on the western side, which gave us a nice view of sunsets, but no view of the strip. It wasn't very soundproof, and we heard car horns, traffic, the train that went by a few blocks away twice/night blowing its horn, and also people in next room talking/laughing at 3:45 a.m. a couple nights. Room had some issues, and we told the front desk person, who told us to tell the guest services person, who told us next time to just call hotel engineering. I almost asked how I was supposed to know that, as there is no hotel information book in the room. One of the issues, a broken desk drawer with screws sticking out, was never fixed or removed. Three other things were taken care of fairly quickly.<br/>&quot;Resort fee&quot; is a crock. It is now $25/day. This gives you copying/fax service, boarding pass printing, one free buffet, one free drink, use of fitness center, free local phone calls, casino club card, and a couple other things. They say the total value is over $100. That's nice if you're staying one night. But we stayed six, and paid 6 nights of fees. You still only get one free buffet and one free drink, no matter how long you stay. Most of the stuff is free anyway at other hotels.<br/>The weekend was geared to the younger crowd (we were four couples all in our 50s). The pool area was completely full of younger guests partying quite heavily with the DJ blaring music to &quot;keep the party going!!&quot; After that is was quite a lot quieter, though. <br/>Overall, just OK. It is a large hotel with a LOT of rooms. It takes a while to get your bearings and find your way. The pirate show was OK to see once. Senor Frog's just opened, but it, too, seems to be geared for younger guests. We like a good time, but not that pounding music, shots-guzzling, yelling/screaming good time stuff. At least not nightly.	3	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	2

We had gotten an offer from the casino as we had played there last year. Because we were guests we did not have to stand in line to check in. The rooms were great, we were on the 23rd floor and the view from our bed was of the entire strip. we never closed the curtains. It was the first time that I saw the new siren show outside. It was great!..The casino itself had enough to do and a variety of things to do at night. It's location is right on the strip with a tram to the mirage, within walking distance of Wynn, Venetian and many others. We ate at the buffet and the cashier there was the best. The food selection was great...sushi, barbeque, pasta, salad. The deserts had a great selection with everything made fresh daily. They make the best doughnuts daily.<br/>The service throughout the hotel was outstanding. We needed a late check out as we were taking the red eye out and they were happy to accomodate us. <br/>I would definately recommend this hotel and would stay again!	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

April 21 to Wed. April 25th. 1st thing I liked is we arrived early for check in, which is normally 3 PM, but they begin check in service at 11 AM. Line for early check in was a little long (took 30 min) but that beats waiting till 3 PM. The hotel itself, especially the room and hallways, are kept updated and in very good condition for a strip hotel around since the early 90's. The room has a dark, wooden interior with a somewhat modern look to it. The pool area is small (one pool, and a hot tub that is really warm, not hot) that got overcrowded on Saturday but was fine Sun - Tue, even during peak pool times. The hotel is toward the far end of the 'modern&quot; strip across from the Venetian, but a quick free tram takes you to the Mirage in minutes. You can find a hotel with cheaper rates, especially if you are part of the Caesars or MGM players club (TI has their own) but the mid-week rates for when we went were reasonable. They do charge a $25 a nite &quot;resort&quot; fee (which gets you into the workout room for free, a 2 for 1 on the buffet and a few other smaller discounts.)	3	3	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

If you aren't aware of it you just aren't paying attention. In return for the resort fee we were given two free buffets and one buy one get one half off.

We really like the location of the hotel property on the strip, easy to walk to so many other hotels, restaurants, the mall, etc. The elevators to the rooms are very close to the entrance which is nice for quick and easy returns to your room. The food choices are perfect and include everything from a large buffett, bar food, Starbucks, Gilleys and the new Senior Frogs mexican bar/restaurant. The pool is perfect and there is wonderful poolside bar service. <br/>I highly recommend when you check in you ask for the highest floor possible. Floors 30-36 (top) are accessed by private elevator. The best rooms on each floor are the end corner units. I was not able to get one this time, but they offer 2 window views and can provide both strip and mountain sights. If you cannot get one, ask for the view of the strip/pirate show, it offers a nice view and plenty of light.<br/>My biggest concern is the gaming and ability to earn loyalty points for future stays. If you are not a slot player and spending hours upon hours of feeding bills into their machines, you'll have little chance for comps. In four days with family in tow, I spent about 10 hours at the tables, and all I earned was a $50 food credit. I will be looking for a new place to stay where I will have a better opportunity to earn better future comp credits.	4	5	-1	4	5	4	-1	4

We were attending a birthday celebration and wanted to be near the party which was taking place at Club Surrender across the street. Our room was on the 31st floor and had an amazing view of the strip and swimming pool. There is also a free tram that leaves every few minutes to and from the Mirage and we made good use of it. We didn't spend a whole lot of time in the room as we had a lot to do during our 4 night stay and there were no issues that I can remember. I do recollect however that the Manager at the Front Desk, a Mr. Dayar, was extremely professional, courteous, friendly and accommodating. He went out of his way to greet us and continued to ask how everything was going throughout our stay. That sort of personal touch is rare at these huge Vegas hotels and was pleasant to see in person. His efforts made our experience a memorable one. We are looking forward to our next trip to Vegas in September	4	5	-1	4	5	5	-1	4

Thought everything was pretty convenient to find. Really enjoyed the buffet, our breakfasts at Kahunaville and the cafe. Food was excellent at Phil's steakhouse. The only thing missing was a coffee pot in the room because we drink a lot of coffee.	4	4	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

I'd stayed here a few years ago with friends &amp; it wasn't bad, but it didn't appear to be as modern as some of the other strip hotels. But boy were we excited when we entered our room this time! The check-in process was quick &amp; easy. We received some coupons for a 2-1 buffet &amp; cocktails. The 33rd floor room wasn't huge, but was cozy &amp; had a warm beige color palette &amp; a view of the strip below overlooking the pirate ship! The bed was comfortable, nice bathroom, &amp; flat-screen tv. The only complaints we had were that the in-room safe didn't work properly &amp; there was no iron in the closet. When we contacted the front desk about this, an iron was promptly delivered to the room &amp; they sent up security in an attempt to repair the safe, but it still didn't work for some reason. The casino was large &amp; smoky (which can't be helped) &amp; busy on most nights. The waitresses were also very visible to offer complimentary drinks while we gambled which was nice. We had pizza at Pizzeria Francesco's which was delicioso &amp; we had dinner one night at The Buffet which was also very good - the roasted turkey is to die for! Overall, this was a wonderful hotel on the strip for the money &amp; we'd do it again in a heartbeat!	5	4	-1	5	4	5	-1	5

We had never been to Vegas before and travelled from Canada. Our room was clean, the staff we encountered was always pleasant at the hotel front desk, house keeping, restaurants, etc. We were aware of the resort fee as we read about it and they honored the original $20/night disclosed to us. There is a smokey smell in the casino but not on the floors or the rooms. We ate breakfast at Kahunaville and they were accommodating to my gluten allergy. We went to see Mystere and it was wonderful! The pool is not very large and finding a lounge chair <br/>Is challenging as the day progresses, but we always managed to get two. My husband went to the Starbucks a few times in the morning. We were going to try Se?or Frogs but the music was so loud and the wait was 30 minutes so we passed. My husband ate at the Pizza Francesco's and was satisfied with the food. We didn't use the other coupons included with the resort fee pkge. The location is great, tram to the Mirage resort, the Fashion show mall and Walgrens is handy. Not so good is that we mentioned it was our 25 wedding anniversary and not only no up grade was offered but not even a happy anniversary from the check in clerk. We did not receive a room with a nice view even though we asked. My husband didn't want to bother with switching rooms, so we stayed. I was disappointed. It was very busy and about 80 people were in line. They has 5 people working the line up and two more came to help out. After we got to the front on the line I looked back and there was another 80 or so behind us again. They allowed late check out by 1 1/2 hours to us. That was handy for us. Overall we were satisfied, but would probably try one of the many other resorts for the experience.	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	-1

I noticed that it is starting to loose its shine. The casino is dark and not inviting. The rooms are showing age. The staff isn't always friendly. It certainly is a good value for the average cost. It could be much worse. It certainly is better than places like the Imperial Palace or Harrahs. Just check prices for other locations. It might only be $20 more a night to stay at a much nicer hotel.<br/><br/>All and all, Vegas is not what it was in the past. I'm finding that flights from the east coast are getting more and more expensive. In some cases I could fly to an island with a casino for less money. Plus cost for food and entertainment is out of control. Breakfast shouldn't cost $22. It isn't NYC.<br/><br/>Cheers.	3	4	-1	3	2	2	-1	3

This is my favourite place to stay in Vegas. I had a strip view room, without asking, even though I understand that a strip view room is more expensive. However, I did ask if the room was close to the elevator. The front desk clerk said &quot;pretty close&quot;. The room was at the very end of the hallway. So much for that. Being a 60+ solo traveller, it would have been a bonus if it was.<br/><br/>The bathroom did have one grab bar at the entry to the bathtub, but it would have been helpful if there was a second grab bar on the wall of the bathtub as it was slippery when taking a shower.<br/><br/>The smoke in the casino was very thick. There wasn't a non-smoking section that I remember seeing. I tried to find a slot machine where there wasn't a smoker nearby, however it wasn't long before a smoker came along.<br/><br/>The housekeeping staff was very friendly. In fact, one morning when I was leaving the room the maid asked me which room I came from and promptly made it up. When I came back to the room shortly thereafter it was nice and clean.<br/><br/>One thing that I found strange is that visiting the pool, you cannot take any outside containers into the pool area. I brought a cup of ice and water and was told to dump it before going to the pool. Another guest had to dump her newly purchased cup of Coke prior to entering too.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay here my next visit.	3	5	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

We will definitely come again!	5	0	I attended a conference at TI the first week of May. My first time in Vegas, I was pleased that we were so conveniently located. The view of the strip was beautiful, even from our lower 10th floor room. As others, we were aware of the resort fee upon booking, and I found it to be a reasonable cost for the amenities we were provided. I am a nonsmoker, although my boyfriend smokes. So when a smoking room was all that was available with a king bed when we arrived, I was hesitant because of my allergies and asthma. Upon entering our smoking room, I found it to be very well cleaned and comfortable enough for me to stay in all week. I even told my boyfriend that if ALL smoking rooms were cleaned as well as this one, we would book a smoking room every time. The hotel room and the casino were well ventilated and comfortable both in aesthetics and spaciousness, but the drink service at the slots was a little slow. With a 2 for 1 buffet coupon, the buffet was priced well. After eating there for lunch, I'm glad we didn't pay full price since the selections did seem a little more ordinary than I would have expected. I may have been a bit too quick to judge, though, since my first experience with a Las Vegas buffet was at the Bellagio the day before. Don't underestimate the buffet here, though, by any means. The service is beyond compare and the food is prepared well. We received better service at the TI buffet than we did at the Bellagio buffet. Our waiter even took the time to wipe off the salt and pepper shakers after we sat down. It was a small gesture, but one that will stay with me for a very long time. Be sure to take your allergy medicine before entering the the lobby to check in. The lines are long, and the floral smell is overwhelming. The desk clerk seemed to need to push too many buttons to check us in; I even asked if everything was ok, worried that there was an issue with my reservation. Fortunately there was not. The desk clerk didn't seem well versed on standard hotel service items, either. We asked for a missing DND sign and he needed us to explain &quot;DND = do not disturb&quot; before he told us to call housekeeping from our room. Thankfully, another supervisor(?) came over and called for us, saving us the additional hassle after waiting in line to ask for a replacement. In-room safes are free, cable is pretty lousy. Mini-fridge in every room keeps you hydrated after drinking at night. Internet is slow, but I suspect that is because there are so many people using it. Kahunaville seemed overpriced on the surface, but the flair bartending show and free shots made it a good value in retrospect. Siren show was slutty but entertaining. Overall, I was very comfortable and found TI to be a great value. And from a veteran hotelier who could stay at other hotels on the strip at an employee rate, that's a compliment well earned and worth sharing.	5	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

Everyone in our group was extremely impressed with the level of service provided as well as TI's facilities. We stayed in a king-sized room, that was spacious, decorated in a modern style and comfortable. The furnishings included a very comfortable bed, bedside tables, desk, entertainment centre and chaise lounge - in addition to ample closet space. The bathroom was large and well-stocked with toiletries from TI's spa. Our room was on one of the higher floors with a great view of the pirate ship used in the Sirens show; in addition to a great view of the strip, we could also see the fireworks from the nightly shows from our window. <br/><br/>As with most of the larger hotel/casino complexes, TI has a range of amenities. The casino itself was always bustling; we're not big into gambling, but it was a fun place to spend a bit of time each day playing the slots. There are a range of restaurants, catering to a variety of tastes/budgets - though all the prices seem a bit elevated compared to what they might be if the restaurants were not affiliated with the hotel. Nonetheless, the quality of all the food we ate was very good. There is also a pool, which is on the small size for a hotel of this size, towards the rear of the hotel. Despite its size, the pool is a nice place to lounge around and enjoy the desert heat. <br/><br/>Based on both stays at TI, we have no complaints. The staff was always helpful, and the level of service provided was impressive. We really enjoyed our stay at TI and would not hesitate to recommend it.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

It is in a really nice location, near the upper end of the strip. There is a walgreens just across the street, where we bought our water for the whole week because even though the tap water is supposed to be safe, it does smell funny. We were really happy with our hotel. The area is really nice, much better than the area near New York, MGM, and Tropicana, which seemed a little ghetto. We booked for the most basic room, but at check in we asked if a high floor one was available, and we were lucky enough to get a high floor room with a great view =) The lobby of the hotel is simple, nothing extravagant like what you'd get in Aria, but we didnt care for that since we never stayed much inside the hotel, and we're not big on gambling.	5	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

We arrived on a Monday afternoon and only had a short wait of 2 or 3 people in the lobby. We requested a respectable room with a strip and pool view, and ended up with an AMAZING view on the 21st floor (room 85). We saw other room views while we were there, and none beat ours! This was my first time in Vegas, and the hotel impressed me.<br/><br/>Overall, it was small enough where I would not get lost, yet large enough to keep me entertained all week. It was only a 5 minute walk from the pool to the elevators, which is nice when you need to go back to the room for something. There was a lot to do with the three exciting bars, and obviously the casino. <br/><br/>POOL: We were poolside everyday from 9-4 and ordered a daybed each day. During the week, it was not busy, so the man who rented the daybeds gave us both for the price of one everyday, which we enjoyed very much. We were treated very, very well when we were in the daybeds. The pool was calm during the week, and got very rowdy on Thursday... tons of younger people that were drunk, loud, and even throwing up. So if you are looking for a peaceful pool, stay here during the week. If you want a party pool, come during the weekend. <br/><br/>You have to show your room key to get in to the pool, and the only outside food or drinks allowed is from Kahunaville, Starbucks, or Ben and Jerrys. They will check your bags. We had alcohol in the room, though, and filled up our cups every few drinks we purchased, and were able to bring it in no problem. <br/><br/>FOOD: We ate poolside everyday at Kahunaville. With the resort fee, you get coupons, and there is a girl passing out kahunaville coupons everynight for a 7.99 breakfast, buy one get one 1/2 off lunch and dinner, and buy one get one free drink. We also ordered room service one night, and ate at senor frogs, but never tried the other restaurants inside. The line for breakfast was always really long.<br/><br/>ENTERTAINMENT: We went to Kahunaville and Senor Frogs almost everynight. Both have food and a ton of entertainment. Senor Frogs is fairly new, but the staff is great, they make you feel like you are part of the team when you dance with them, and treat you nicely. Beware-- you get a ton of free drinks and shots in both bars.... Senor Frogs has a nice view of the pirate show, but we never saw it because it was too windy and they cancelled it. <br/><br/>ETC: We were doing a red eye flight on Thursday night and we requested a late check out or a half rate room. We had to call down the morning of, and see what was available. We did this three times, and finally in person, we ended up with a full night for 50 dollars, once we talked to a nice manager. A woman at the desk was quoting 80, but he knocked it down when we came down in person again. <br/><br/>We saw Mystere on a Tuesday night at 7pm and it was amazing. If you sit in the closer seats, there will most likely be audience participation... Don't forget, you get a discount if you stay at TI.	5	3	-1	5	4	4	-1	5

The main reasons for staying there was that we booked a room at the last minute for $149/night (all the other &quot;nice&quot; hotels were $200+), and it's walking distance from the Venetian, where we were going to see a DJ at Tao (see separate review). We checked in around 3pm on Friday and of course there was a huge line, so it took at least 30 minutes to check in, which I suppose isn't too bad. The room at first glance looks nice, but upon closer inspection you can see lots of wear and tear. We found the bed comfortable, but the mattress pad was lumpy-looking, plus the linens had several scuff marks on them--they appeared clean, though, so apparently they're just stained and need replacing. The paint is chipped/scraped all over the room, and the bathroom towels are very rough/scratchy. The toiletries smelled funny to me, although my husband thought they were OK. Basic flat panel TV and iPod/clock radio worked fine, as did the A/C &amp; heating system. The pool looked absolutely tiny for such a large hotel! It must be at capacity all the time. We ate dinner at The Coffee Shop and were surprised at how expensive it was. Our bill came to $90 (before tip) for a chicken quesadilla appetizer, club sandwich, shrimp fettucini alfredo, a soda, and a couple beers! Check-out was a breeze because they had an attendant take our name and key cards, but I believe we were told a copy of the bill would be mailed and we have yet to receive it. Bottom line: I would not stay here again unless I had to, and would not recommend it to anyone I know.	3	3	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

The bath room was a great size with a huge vanity area and walk in shower.<br/><br/>Food - We ate in the Jungle themed restaurant &amp; the mini burger apertizer is beautiful. The three of us all ordered an apertizer; wings, mini burgers &amp; nachos &amp; couldn't finish them. If i'm honest it was a little expensive but not over the top.<br/><br/>Location - The location was brill, i preferred it to the Luxor. You're right opposite the Venitian, next to the Mirage. It'll take you about 20mins to get up to the MGM Grand.<br/><br/>Overall - I'd definately stay at this hotel again, i thought the price was brilliant for where it's based and the room size &amp; quality.	5	5	-1	5	4	5	-1	5

My room was 'roomy' and very comfortable and certainly for the price it was excellent value. My only slight complaint would be that my room could have been a bit cleaner. I noticed a toothpaste mark (not mine!) on the basin which was there for 2 days! Staff were ok but being Vegas it's slightly impersonal but that suited me fine.	4	4	-1	4	3	3	-1	4

Checked in @ 2 pm, long line, but moved quickly. Booked 3 nights @ $159 + $25 resort fee + tax in one-king room with Strip view. We could see the tip of Mirage's volcano and Ballagio's water ballet. Nice furniture, very comfortable bed, quiet refrigerator. Used hotel coupons for breakfast and drinks at a saving. <br/>Negatives: Loud music from pool noon to 6 pm. Poor sound insulation and we could hear every word next door. Dusty furniture table tops. Most TI restaurants only have &quot;average&quot; review.	4	4	-1	3	3	4	-1	3

I checked in mid afternoon on a Tuesday in a VIP line so I had no wait. The room was great, I asked to be away from the elevator but when I got to my room it was right by the elevator. That being said I never heard any noise so it was all in all a quite time. Unlike most I detest Vegas so I spent my time at the convention center working eating dinner or chillaxin in my room. The TI buffet is not that great, I went next door to the Mirage and ate there and it was a stellar buffet with a great selection. One night I went to Capital Grill at the mall next door-separate review because it was that good! My bed was soo amazing very comfortable, the bathroom was roomy and they have a fridge in the room that was good to stick waters in. I had a room facing the strip and the mirage so I didn't have to hear the sirens show. 2 Starbucks on property. Senior Frogs is loud and a party so go if your want some fun.	5	4	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

The pool area was a cool scene, and we had no problem getting lounge chairs there. <br/><br/>My problem is with the $25 PER DAY resort fee they charge on top of the room rate. It's in the fine print when you book, but it's a their way of making the rooms look cheaper compared to other hotels on travel sites. On top of that, I was offended by their propaganda material they handed me at check-in that explained why this fee would &quot;enhance my stay&quot;. Don't spit on me and tell me it's raining! Boycott TI and the other hotels until they stop these shady pricing strategies! And the check in line took about 15-20 minutes on a Saturday afternoon...can't imagine what Friday is like.	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	3	-1	-1

This is a good location to stay in Vegas. On the strip and a good casino to stay at if your not looking to travel. Has tram service in the building to get you to the strip South and more fun if you do want to travel. Shopping and food court next door to the North. The comfort of the rooms was outstanding, clean (new) linens and room. Room had a small mini fridge to help keep drinks cool, safe, hair dryer, and iron. No coffee maker or microwave as is the same for most properties in town. Does have two Starbucks for morning coffee, and also a Krispy Kreme gift shop at the top of the steps to the parking garage if you don't want to wait in line for the java. Also has an car rental in house up these steps. View to the North and East was good but would think a South view is better view of strip. East view looks over the Stage for the Sirens show, but not the best view of it, go outside and watch if interested. High floor (34th) had a great view of the Las Vegas world.<br/>Now here's the great kick of the place, Wild Pool...young (20 to 30 yr olds), so being 50 something had to live with it, It has DJ sound playing, plenty of lounge space, full service bar and great waitress service always circulating if you need something. Has an extension to Kahunaville for food at a couple outside tables next to the pool, good for a snack. Chips and Artichoke dip for ~ $10. No outside food and drink allowed in. <br/>The hotel takes a bit to navigate, front desk to room elevators and from parking garage takes you around the corners from each other and through the casino. Line at check in went quickly, but there is a line, bring your iPod. (@12:00 noon, Sat.)<br/>The only thing that I missed was a place to sit outside in the morning with a cup of coffee or Bloody Mary. Would be a nice touch for hotel guests (pool area only opened at 9:00). May be there is one, but didn't ask.	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	5

As always, we were both quite happy with our choice. TI has an excellent location on the strip- take the free trolley from TMI to Mirage &amp; walk onto the busiest part of the strip; Cross one pedestrian bridge to access FashionShow Mall, cross another to accesss Venetian/Palazzo. For location alone, it gets high marks.<br/><br/>As with all our previous trips we checked-in at the &quot;Invited Guests&quot; line, as we were staying at the invitation of the hotel. We did notice the &quot;regular&quot; front desk was not busy (Thursday @ 4PM-ish). We requested &amp; received an upgrade to a top-floor (36th), strip-view room. We were also offered a complimentary bottle of champage delivered to our room (which we never used!).<br/><br/>Our 36th floor room was typical of TI rooms. Clean and comfortable, but relatively small. we had two beds, as there were no single bed, strip-view, top floor rooms available. Bathroom was clean &amp; functional. The flat panel TV in our room was broken (stuck on- could not turn-off or change channels upon arrival. We called down to the front desk &amp; they sent a tech up within minutes to fix it- no issue. The whole floor was quieyt, so no noise issues. Never saw our cleaning ladies, but they kept the room very clean. Bed was incredibly comfortable- I truly LOVE the mattresses @ TI- they offer me the best sleep I get anywhere, period.<br/><br/>Not much has changed at TI since our last visit three years ago except Gilley's had moved-in. Never drank at Gilley's, but did walk in &amp; tour the place- it looks like a fun place to spend an evening. The new Senor Frogs was not yet open when we stayed in early April, but has since opened I see from news reports &amp; postings on TA- I would be interested in checking it out on our next trip.<br/><br/>Ate at Canter's Deli, as we always do. Sandwiches are very big &amp; quite good, but a bit pricey, but worth it if you like deli. Coffee Shop is a coffee shop, but expensive. We ate breakfast there twice, but wife &amp; I both agree it;s too expensive for a &quot;simple&quot; breakfast &amp; we will not plan on eating there on future visits. <br/><br/>Phil's Italian Steakhouse: DISGUSTING and disgustingly overpriced. Here's the story: On the 2nd (Friday) night of our trip, the casino marketing manager sought-out my wife at the slot machine she was playing at. My wife is an &quot;active gambler&quot; (TI's term for heavy gamblers). The manager told my wife he felt compelled to seek her out as he noticed she was very active, and also notoced we had nothing but a sandwich from Canter;s charged to our room so far. He strongly urged her to &quot;charge more to our room&quot; as he was anxious to comp us (our offer already gave us $150 F&amp;B credit, 3-weekend-nights &amp; $390 free play). Our trip was fully planned, including a super-nice dinner across the street at Bouchon in Venetian. After my wife's talk with the manager, we decided it would be best to cancel our Bouchon dinner &amp; book into Phil's ostensibly the best/most expensive restaurant in TI, in order to take advantage of at least some of the comps we had been offered. Being a reall &quot;foodie&quot;, I expected little from Phil's- it had never even crossed my mind as a dining option, frankly. I can have excellent staek anywhere, no need to waste my precious vegas dining time with substandard steaks IMHO. Well, all I can say is, at least it was free. Wife's French Onion Soup was totally tasteless. Her steak was tough. My steamed clams had an awful metallic taste. My lobster was rubbery- way overcooked. Our meal, with only one glass of wine for my wife (I had already drank too much that afternoon watching hockey at the Breeze Bar so decided to take an alcohol break) was over $200 before tip. AVOID PHIL's STEAKHOUSE!<br/><br/>TI is a well-located, mid-sized hotel/casino. My wife &amp; I enjoy it for many reasons &amp; intend to continue using it as our &quot;home&quot; hotel when visiting Vegas. Despite the negative comments about food at the Coffee Shop &amp; Phil's, I still love TI. I just know to eat elsewhere. After all, after gambling IMHO, Vegas is all about the incredible variety of restaurants from high-end celebrity chef fine dining to the classic In-N-Out fast food burger restaurants.	5	5	-1	3	5	4	-1	5
UR129597066	DDF27C7611374232F1DE1E015F3CFDAC	Treasure Island - TI Hotel & Casino	Las_Vegas_Nevada	2012-05-08	Great value, but a tired hotel.	3	0	We stayed two nights (Sat. and Sun.) in early May in a Tower Suite and averaged about $185 per night. I have to say, that is the best part. For a 930sf suite, that's an outstanding price.<br/><br/>On the bad side, the hotel is old now, and tired. Furniture is dated and worn and the suites, while clean, are about fifteen to twenty years past prime. This doesn't make it a bad stay, and I have to say, for the money, it's a very good deal and has a great location on the strip. Just don't expect the Wynn/Encore, or the other newer hotels.<br/><br/>Other observations: The casino was smoky. I don't smoke, but if you're going to spend any time in the casino, you will smell like smoke and have a difficult time avoiding it. Hotel is understaffed as most of them are these days and a couple of them took the time to complain openly which is always a red flag. Vegas is, of course, a party town, but if you're there for work, don't expect to get an early nights sleep as the fireworks show lasts until midnight and is right outside your window.<br/><br/>One final issue, and it's not just this hotel, I had this same situation with the Wynn. I always thought that I was paying for my room at check-in time which in this case, is 3:00 p.m. However, there is no guaranteed check in time, and they will give you your room &quot;when it's ready.&quot; 3:00 is a goal, but not a promise, and if someone in your room got a late check out or there is some other reason, well then you're out of luck and will have to wait &quot;until it's ready.&quot; Which could be any time and certainly not a specific time that you can plan around. I personally don't like that system and if I vacated the property on those terms, I'd get charged extra.<br/><br/>All of this being said, I wouldn't avoid this hotel, and for the money would probably stay there again. It's just like anything else, if you're paying a cheap price, expect to make some sacrifices.	4	5	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

Although the rooms themselves were very spacious and well appointed, we found the overall experience average. The location was great and very close to bus, shopping, central strip area. The casino and restaurants were so-so. We are non-smokers so found the casino quite smokey at times. The food in the restaurant were ok only and faily expensive for the money. The buffet was average at best. The buffet at the Mirage next door was much bigger and nicer but still not great quality food (the eggs were a weird texture and flavourless but the cold crab legs were great). The pool area was small with a limited number of chairs. It was also a very loud, 'party' pool with blaring music and lots of young people drinking. The gym was surprinsingly well equipped with both cardio and weight machines. They provided water, towels and fruit. It was busy most mornings but I always found equipment to work out on. We didn't like the fact that check out was at 11 am and there was no place to use if you had a late flight - no place to shower, change (if you wanted to use the pool) or just sit and read and visit. The staff were fine, not offensive but not memorable either. The hotel was very clean though. All in all a fine stay but that's it.	3	4	-1	4	5	3	-1	4

The last night we were there, we had to be up ridiculously early, and were in bed early. Being woken up by cannons and fireworks was a bit unnerving, but definitely not the end of the world. If you're not going to be in your room before 11:00 p.m., you won't even need to worry about it.<br/><br/>The room itself was just what we needed. Comfortable king bed, spacious bathroom and convenient mini fridge.<br/><br/>Ate at Gilley's, the buffet and Kahunaville, and they were all very good. The Starbucks in the hotel doesn't open very early, but the one outside is open 24 hours (at least it was when we were there). Can't wait to go back and try out Senor Frog's!<br/><br/>The pool is a bit small, but there are plenty of loungers if you're not interested in swimming.<br/><br/>The location and size of TI are what will bring me back. It's a very quick journey from your room to the strip. Drink service in the casino is probably the fastest out of any casino I've been in.	5	5	-1	5	4	4	-1	4

Everything about this place is average at best. The bar sucks, the casino is average, location is pretty good, the rooms small and crappy don't waste your money on strip view or anything like that since its pretty pathetic and small window no balcony. The pool and vibe is pretty pathetic as well, small and dingy not much going on. <br/><br/>Obviously if you come to vegas to party you won't stay at your hotel much but why stay here when you can stay somewhere that rocks?? Would never go back, waste of money and a crummy hotel. They charge you this resort fee which I understand most places do but you get nothing for it and the wifi is garbage at this hotel, totally useless almost. <br/><br/>Basically totally unhappy with this old, outdated, and generally boring spot.	2	4	-1	2	3	2	-1	3

It could have been even better but for one or two things which just took the edge of it.<br/><br/>The check in was quite well organised, a clear line marked out it just took a little while to be seen. I wasn't quite sure why this was until we got there and then I realised the staff took a little time with each guest. In our case, the guy was saying that because we booked a certain rate, the resort fee was optional and asked us a few questions to see whether it was worth it for us (it was for us).<br/><br/>The room was really nice, for the price, I thought it really represented good value. Just a standard room with a king bed. The only downside was a fan or something similar was outside our room, albeit a few floors down which I could hear - doesn't bother me as I am a VERY heavy sleeper but my girlfriend is a light sleeper and even she had no problems.<br/><br/>We thought the hotel had lots to do casino wise - in the UK you can't smoke inside anymore but the people smoking in the casino didn't bother me. A great range of machines. The bars/restaurants offered a good range for everyone (tropical bars, pizza, Mexican food, I could go on!). $3 drafts in Gilley's was awesome value! We had a 2 for 1 coupon for the buffet after paying for the resort fee which offered us an excellent value champagne brunch - drinks service could be a little slow in the buffet but the food was really good for buffet food with a good choice.<br/><br/>The only real problem I had with the place was the room key charging, I was a secondary name on the account but supposed to have full charging ability on my card. In one restaurant, we explained to the guy when he said he couldn't see my name on the charge and he was great about it, however, in the main casino bar he refused to listen to me and wouldn't call the front desk after I'd been advised to suggest that by the front desk when I went to deal with he issue after the first time. So maybe just something to be aware of if it happens to you (when I went back to the front desk (who were very nice about it) I was told I should have asked to speak to his manager and got the manager to call the front desk if the barman wouldn't). <br/><br/>All in all, if there weren't so many other places in Vegas I wanted to try, I'd certainly weigh anchor at the Treasure Island again!	5	4	-1	5	5	3	-1	5

The positives: Decided last minute to get the Petitie Suite, it was great having two FULL sized bathrooms since I was traveling with another female. Room exceeded expectations. Restaurants were nice, buffet was nicer than reviews indicated but very pricey. CONS: Casino not great, slot machines were TIGHT TIGHT TIGHT. Recommendations: Shopping is a hidden treasure there. Alot of great malls are hidden in the nice hotels. You would think they would be pricey, but we found some great shopping in Caesars Forum. The best secret of all is in the Venetian. Has a great food court across from TI, great shops and very affordable. Loved the casinos at Paris, Wynn, Venetian etc. Downtown is worth going to see at night, wasn't sure what to expect but the lights are amazing. The bus pass $7 for 24 hours up and down the strip is the best bet. Catch the bus in the afternoon and the 24 hour pass allows you ride time the next day as well. Overall, we were pleased with the hotel, service good, rooms clean, food good, beds were SUPER comfy, casino...eh. Stayed on 31st floor overlooking south strip, amazing. Hoover dam was also a great trip!	3	4	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

We did get charged the resort fee, didnt really pay attention to what it was for nor did I really care. The rooms here are your basic, the beds are phenominal. Rooms are very clean and well kept event though they might not be the most extravagent. That bathroom was pleasantly spacious ( we needed that as we travelled all females). The Cirque du Soliel show at T.I is Mystere and its pretty neat if you are into that sort of thing. The buffet is worth its price ! There is a pirate show nightly outside where the big boat is ( cant miss it). We didnt have any problems here at all.

The location is great, Easy access to other resorts and the fashion mall. Check-in on Monday was fast, but I did not get the upgrade I was looking for. I did get an upgraded strip view but it was not the end room I got last time. The bathroom looked recently remodeled with all the marble type tile looking fresh and well kept. The bed was too soft and sagging at the top and sides. There is a resort fee, but they give 2 for 1 coupons and other perks to make up for it. One is free phone service which is good because cell reception is sketchy in rooms. The free internet is good also.The restaurants and clubs. Gilley's is fun and entertaining. Kahunaville has a good breakfast with a discount coupon, Starbucks had 1/2 price in the afternoon. The buffet is average with the deserts above average. A maid did try to enter our room at 11 P.M. using her key immediately after knocking. The only thing that stopped her was the hasp lock as there is no other interior lock. This was a scare since we didn't know who was trying to get in the room at this time of night. I was right by the door and barely had time to slam it back shut.	4	5	-1	3	4	4	-1	3

We booked it because Lastminute had some fantastic reduction and we paid peanuts for it. I don't think you go to Vegas for lounging around the pool, if you did, then the TI pool area is very crowded (but I think every single hotel was the same). The rooms were large and spotless. We looked out over Trump Tower rather than the strip, which I suppose could have been better, but if you're spending any amount of time in your room in Vegas you're not having a good time! The casino was absolutely fine and the hotel is really well located for access to the strip. In fact, it's location must be its primary selling point, that and the pirate show every night, it's good harmless fun. If you can get a good deal at TI, go for it. Other than using the private facilities of any of the hotels (like the pools) you could stay in any one and get an equally good experience, provided they're well located, which this one is. I can't compare it with any other, other than aesthetically (it looked smaller than the other towers nearby) but we enjoyed our stay and definitely would stay again. Beds = really comfy to sleep off the night before!	5	5	-1	4	5	3	-1	5

If you do decide to stay there, make sure that they put you on the 18th floor facing the stripe towards the south! it is worth it! i told them it is our honey moon and my wife's time so they upgraded it for free.

I agree with most of the pro's and con's that other reviewers have shared. But my 3-night stay with my girlfriend was made particularly bad for a few reasons. We changed rooms after the 1st night because the door rattled loudly every time something moved in the hallway, and the air conditioner couldn't keep the room cool. The tub drain was completely clogged in the next room. All minor annoyances. The real kicker was the extremely poor customer service we received at every turn. Long (45 min) wait times at the lobby and unknowledgeable staff. And the 2 free buffet coupons I got as part of staying here? Apparently they weren't valid at any time on the weekend, which is a joke and is really poorly described on the vouchers. If they had given them to me upon check-in Thursday night I would have at least had a chance to use them - but the receptionist forgot and I retrieved them later (too late, I guees). When I complained to the restaurant manager and asked if they would honor the coupons for lunch on Saturday, he was very rude and refused. Awful customer service from this hotel. Nothing worse that thinking that you're getting perks only to be disappointed by misleading stipulations and rude management.	1	3	-1	3	3	1	-1	2

Unfortunately, my sister and I had a bad experience with the front desk receptionists. The male receptionist who handled me was rude, sarcastic, and inconsiderate. We checked in last april 28, 2012 around 11:30 in the evening. I was informed that the preferred non-smoking room was not available. I insisted but informed me instead that the preferrence specified on on-line booking is not always guaranteed even if I have to check all the hotels in Vegas. It would have been understandable with the beds but the health of the client should be considered when it comes to smoking and non-smoking room. ?I informed him that I am asthmatic and what if it will be triggered by cigarette smoke. His sarcastic reply was... He was also an asthmatic and he knows what asthma is. Well it just so happen that I am a physician and I told him that I know more what asthma is. He was unfazed by the remark and still gave me the smoking room and told me that I will just request for a transfer the next day which was already impossible. Aside from the hassle, I had a scheduled early meeting the next day. ?My sister also got a problem with her booking and the first female receptionist who handled her left (I think it was the end of her shift) without endorsing her to her colleague. Good thing the next receptionist, who saw her an hour later, was helpful enough and she was given 2 non-smoking rooms. I <br/>thought there was none available at that time!<br/><br/>?	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1

It was conveniently located for our agenda. It would have been &quot;very good&quot; if not for the waste of money resort fee. It may appear cheaper than other hotels but many other's don't have the resort fee ($20 a day for basically just the use of the pool and fitness center). Our room was on the 20th floor and was very quiet and a non-smoking floor which was evident.

My last stay was May 9th through the 14th, 2012. I arrived at 3pm on a Wednesday and there were about 6 people ahead of me at check-in, but the line moved very quickly and I only had to wait about 10 minutes. The young woman who checked me in was very nice and gave me a room with a view of the strip and pool without any extra charge. The view from my room was gorgeous - I had a clear view of the Mirage volcano and could also see the Bellagio fountains in the distance! The room was clean and well-appointed with a fridge, chaise lounge, the most comfortable bed ever, and a deep soaking tub. Housekeeping was great; they were all very friendly and did a great job of keeping my room clean. All of the staff at TI were kind and helpful. I tried out the buffet several times and was always very happy with that. In fact, I found it to be even better than the buffet at the Mirage. Another plus is that they have a couple of the gift shops open all night, which was great for me, since I'm a night owl. As far as the casino goes, they had a lot of penny machines and several of them suited my taste (i.e. double and triple diamond machines, triple slingo, etc.). My only complaint is the $25/night plus tax &quot;resort fee&quot; which comes out to $28/night after taxes. While they were very upfront with this, I feel that the fee is much too high and I wish they would lower it a little. But other than that, I am very happy with this hotel and would definitely stay there again! :)	4	5	-1	4	4	5	-1	5

Big mistake. Because we had a 5 1/2 hour flight from Florida, we were tired, and we had booked our trip months in advance. I called a week before arriving to make sure everything was ok, and they said it was. When we arrived at Treasure Island, I gave the concierge my name and paper work, he said, &quot;We don't keep reservations.&quot; WHAT? THEN WHAT IS THE POINT OF MAKING THEM? He said he could give us a room with a king sized bed and another smoking room. No. After I asked for the manager, the concierge magically found our two rooms that we had booked. The service is very poor and unreliable. It took a 30 minute talk with the concierge to get this straitened out. <br/>Also, the room were dirty. We asked housekeeping to change our sheets because there was red gunk on them, and they didn't do it.	2	4	-1	3	2	1	-1	3

My first experience here was great. The rooms were newly renovated and the beds were comfortable. After telling the front desk attendant it was our first stay at TI they gave us a free room upgrade to a &quot;strip view&quot; room on the 31st floor, which had great views of the south strip including the Venetian right across the street, Caesars Palace, the Mirage and everything down the strip. It was very easy to check in, also the hotel did have many great restaurants and a good casino. It was less than a 5 minute walk from our room to Las Vegas Blvd. Everything you need is close by. <br/><br/>The 2nd time we stayed here i was pick pocketed after arriving at the property and was left with no ID or Credit card to be able to check in. The hotel staff was very helpful and understanding and allowed me to check in without a credit card not charging me the $25 resort fee (which i have yet to see the value of charging this fee to hotel guests, MGM resorts needs to really lower this fee). <br/><br/>Overall TI is a great property with a lot of updated and modern features. The Sirens of TI show is right out front and its just a great place to have a good classic Vegas experience.	4	5	-1	4	4	5	-1	4

Unfortunately when we checked into our room, housekeeping had not done a great job. There were long hairs on the floor of the bathrooms (our room had 2 bathrooms) and there were soap stains on the counter. Our daughter was to sleep on the pullout couch, which they were aware of upon check in, however, when bedtime came it was shocking to find that there were no bed clothes on the pullout. This necessitated a 12:30 a.m. call to housekeeping to fix the problem. The toilet ran all night, keeping us awake. We went to the front desk in the morning and were offered another room or to be put on their champagne list. We asked that the room be cleaned to our liking and took the champagne. The room never did get properly cleaned. When we went downstairs to gamble, we spent 3 hours and did not find a single drink girl. Finally a security guard went to find someone for us. Apparently two girls had called in sick however, the next night we encountered the same problem. The pool area was lovely. We loved the location and the hotel itself, however, unless the housekeeping improved, we would not stay at this hotel again.	3	5	-1	5	1	1	-1	3

When we got there we found the service to be friendly. We were suprised to learn that we did not have to pay the $25 a night fee. We had learned that the way the travel agent booked the trip - the fee was waved. That was a plus. Especially since we had no use for the amenidities it included.<br/>Our room was nice and clean. The bed was unbelievable!!! So very comfy!! Our room overlooked the Siren show. We never heard a thing from the 27 floor.<br/>I did use the spa for hair and make-up. The make-up artist was fantastic. The hair, I could have done myself.<br/>Overall I am not sure if we will stay at TI again. Not that I did not like it. We just tend to stay at different places each time we go. However, I would recommend.	4	5	-1	3	4	4	-1	5

Yes it's not the over the top luxury like the bellagio, but the rooms are fantastic and in great location. Whats the point in paying extorcianate rate for a hotel when you can stay inTI and visit those hotels anyway.<br/>One tging don't pay for strip view as we did and our friends didn't and they got a better view, I complained but unfortunate to no avail (only complaint)	5	5	-1	5	5	3	-1	5

Recently renovated, I find that it is hard to beat the price value for a good quality room in a prime Strip location. Close walking distance to many of the other major hotel/casinos. I also have had great food at their on-site 24 hour cafe, which is a great perk after a night on the town. I will definitely always have TI in consideration for my Vegas trips.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Rooms were great. Variety of restuarants available on site, drinks establishments, were abundant, from Country to relaxing to Party til you Drop. DJ spun the tunes by the pool on the wekend turning it into a party atmosphere, but quiet during the week. Ambience of this hotel is fantastic. Their is a resort fee applicable for this hotel, but it includes your internet, free local calls, access to the fitness centre, things you pay extra for daily at many other hotels. Used the spa, had a massage, recommend it. In otherwards, TI is a great stay that I would highy reccomend, and I have also stayed at the Bellagio. I preffer TI!	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Can't beat hotels location! It's right in the middle of the action on the street. Shopping mall is across the street. The rooms are nice, we had a king size bed, flat screen tv, normal bathroom. Went to the spa for a massage. The spa is connected to the gym that they have in the hotel. The waiting room was very nice. They give you a robe and slippers when you walk in and you get a locker to put all of your stuff in. While waiting for your treatment you can have snacks, drinks (water, tea, juice) and for after there are vanity areas to freshen up.	4	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

We stayed May 13-18 and have been to Vegas several times. This is our second stay at TI and well worth it. The Casino is a little on the smaller side, but nice service and atmosphere. Gilley's was fun, pool was awesome !!!! Food in several resturants was good to great - pizza is a must !!!! Little tip - get coffee from the Breeze Bar in the morning and get the Bucket of Beer special for HHour !!! Front Desk could be a little happier to be working. Stayed in a P.Suite - very clean and spacious. One day Housekeeping &quot;missed&quot; our room - front desk was nice and sent someone right up with what we needed. TI Players Club was great - nice comps !!!! Overall would stay again and would recommend. I agree there are many high end places to stay - but save the money and spend it on a show or the tables !!! And walk to the high end hotels to enjoy them !!!	5	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

It was our first trip to Las Vegas &amp; we were joining other family members there who had already selected this hotel. We arrived around midnight and were the only ones checking in so that went really well. Another couple experienced about a 45 minute wait earlier in the day. We had requested rooms close to each other and the hotel accommodated us but it ended up causing a problem for the 3rd couple who arrived the next day. We left a message that we were waiting for them at the pool. Unfortunately the room the hotel had reserved for them was not ready until almost 4pm &amp; they were left to roam around for 2 hours because they couldn't access the pool area without a room key &amp; weren't given our message till they actually had checked in. Seems like the desk should have checked for messages when they tried to check in but we mostly chalked it up to a comedy of errors.<br/>As with most Vegas hotels you have to pass by the casino area to get to the elevators or anywhere else in the hotel. We all had very red eyes and a couple had really sore throats by the end of our stay from the smoke. At first we thought this was just unavoidable, but as we toured many of the other big hotels we all agreed that the air quality at TI was noticeably worse than the others.<br/>The rooms were fine - large, comfortable beds, lovely bathrooms &amp; appeared to be fairly recently renovated.<br/>I am puzzled by the reviewers who commented on the cleanliness at this hotel. Our rooms were ok although we all joked about the pretzel/ gum wrapper etc that was under the table/chaise when we arrived and remained undisturbed throughout our stay. Our room was missed entirely one day. Still not terrible, but the public areas were quite disappointing. The pool was disgusting even at opening time &amp; the staff never seemed to collect any garbage or abandoned glasses until closing time. The very worst was Canter's Deli. We stopped in to grab a quick lunch &amp; changed tables twice before finding one that wasn't gross. There are table lamps on the booth tables that were visibly thick with greasy dust.<br/>The resort fee ends up being $28/day with tax so don't forget to calculate this into your price comparison.<br/>The best thing about TI for us was the location. There's lots to do in easy walking distance. And we often took advantage of the walkway to the Fashion Mall for cheaper eating options.<br/>As I didn't choose this hotel, I didn't do any price comparisons so it may be a good value as others have indicated but I would not return.	-1	5	-1	3	2	-1	-1	4

Well, this year after our day out they wanted to try the newly opened Se?or Frogs for supper. It hadn't even been open for a week yet, but you would never know it. They were so well organized, and their main objective was for everyone to have a great time. There was a host band, who came out into the crowd and got them to sing along to &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot;, a conga line where you drank shots along the way, and my personal favorite was when the whole staff comes out and does a synchronized routine to a medley of songs like Greased Lightning and Y.M.C.A.<br/>The food was good and plentiful with reasonable prices, but alcoholic drinks is where they get you. They were pretty pricey! But, we had such a good time it was worth it. Go check it out.	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1

We got a deal through a local agent for ?147 for the 3 nights including the resort fee - bargain. We decided to upgrade to a petite suit when we arrived which was an extra $70 a night. The petite suit has 2 bathrooms, a living area &amp; our room had a view looking south up the Strip. The lifts were also quick up to the 25th floor. Casino floor was average, nothing special but ok for a couple of hours. Staff I spoke to seemed friendly enough &amp; the room, hotels &amp; casino were clean. Having stayed at Sahara, Stratosphere, NY NY, Mirage, Bally's, Bill's, Flamingo and Harrah's TI measures up well, it's a good mid priced hotel &amp; casino. If you can get a good deal it's a great place to stay. Oh, and the beds are sooooo comfortable!	5	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	5

It's in the middle of everything. The staff are great. Especially Toni and Linda on the blackjack tables. We were laughing our butts off with them all night. <br/><br/>As for the hotel, the rooms are spacious and well kept. Lots of storage space. Internet included in the resort fee. <br/><br/>The buffet has lots of choices, but isn't very tastey You get free passes though. So you really can't complain too much about a free meal.<br/><br/>The pool isn't the most immaculate I've ever seen, but it is pretty good and there is a weekend DJ. <br/><br/>Overall I highly recommend the hotel.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	-1

Check in was friendly, but promised champaign didn't show up to room. Bell hop said he would come to carry luggage from RV parking, he never showed up....guess it was too far to walk? We had to carry all our luggage back to hotel. Buffet overpriced and tasteless. Chef at pasta bar undercooked food - pasta literally had cold spots! I didn't finish my meal...scared to get food poisoning! Waitress was loud, when I asked for a glass of red wine, she pretty much announced to the whole room that &quot;that would be 9$ extra&quot; like it was something really bad. (but really $9 for a glass of house wine? really.) I took 15 mins for the wine to show up. Room was ok, but when I opened the drawer to the bed side table, it has some lub slimed in the inside and some previous guests mini vibrator and condoms in it. There was an old broken charger for something protruding from under the bed. Kinda made me wonder how much real cleaning goes on there.....ick.	3	3	-1	3	2	2	-1	3

At that height you don't really see the show, but can watch some fireworks from your window. We discovered the next morning that the shower curtain didn't look too clean and the bath tub was filling up so that we had water at about ankle level by the end of the shower. I reported this to concierge and both problems were taken care of before we got back to our room and from then on no problem at all. The staff was outstanding, helpful and kind and seemed to want to make sure that we had a good stay. I would rate: front desk, concierge, casino staff (players club, cashiers, waitresses), housekeeping and bell hops as very competent and reliable. <br/><br/>They have upped their daily (extra) fee from $20 to $25. At the time of our reservation it was $20 and with that extra amount added in, the room rate we were offered was the same or better than some other nearby casinos. We weren't interested in using the fitness room or having internet access during our stay so there was no value to this fee for us. We did get 2 or 3 papers and 1 buy-1 get-1-free buffet for our 4 day stay and the extra $80 expense.<br/><br/>After arriving at home, I found that an extra id I had in my carry-on and a gift from my young cousins was missing from my carryon. The only time I left my carryon out of my sight was when we had it checked at the bell hop station - since we had to be out of the room 3-4 hours prior to going to the airport. I don't know for sure if it was them, but am suspicious. I haven't called back to the resort yet, but plan to. I wanted to search thru all my things before reporting this.<br/><br/>The bell hop was at our door after we called for our luggage to be picked-up within a couple minutes. I was really amazed. The bell hop that took our bagage out to the curb to wait on the shuttle was extremely nice and it was a pleasure to talk to him. Who knows who could have went thru our bag while it was checked or if something happened at the airport while they searched our bags.	5	5	-1	4	4	5	-1	4

I wish we could have taken it home :o)<br/><br/>Housekeeping: I am not sure exactly what TI's housekeeping all entails, however - <br/> The only housekeeping we recieved was a bed making.<br/>Garbage's were full and towels were left on the floor.<br/>I am not being picky, by any means - I have no problem picking up after myself lol...<br/>But there are people out there who may just want to relax and not worry about small things like this - Especially when you have paid a fairly large amount to stay in a nice place with an offered service.<br/><br/>All of the workers were very friendly and chatty. <br/>Especially front desk - They were the most helpful and very kind.<br/><br/> The Money Wheel is a different story - Both hosts at the wheel did not converse, or have a smile on their face.<br/>We definitely did not feel welcomed while playing and did not stay at the table very long.<br/><br/><br/> Restaurants: <br/><br/>Kahunaville was a lot of fun to eat at - although very cold inside (as are all the casinos inside). <br/> The coffee is not so good, but the menu had some pretty tasty things to choose from.<br/>There is a little water show they put on every 20 minutes or so, which is very nice to watch during your meal :)<br/><br/>The Coffee Shop - Very pricey, especially if you are just looking for a quick fix to get you going. The food was pretty tasty, until we had ended up with a small black hair in the eggs.<br/> They had no problem taking it away and reimbersing for the cost of the eggs. <br/>We did not eat there again.<br/><br/>The Buffet - Yes GO! Delicious, Delicious, Delicious. Lots to choose from, you will definitely never get bored (or go hungry)! Make sure to use your 2 for 1 or FREE coupon you recieve upon check-in.<br/> If I could eat there every day, I would. And the wait staff - VERY nice!<br/><br/><br/>The Pool:<br/><br/> We loved hanging out by the pool. Lots of good loud music, people and plenty of chairs. <br/>It is very expensive if you want to drink however and you are not allowed to bring your own drinks down to the pool area. <br/> I think about $42 for 5 beers, just to give you an idea.<br/><br/><br/>Sirens of TI: <br/><br/> Both times we went to watch the show, it was cancelled due to wind. Disappointing, but nobody's fault. Next time we will definitely have to catch it!! <br/><br/> <br/>** Oh, just a little side note. We had a late flight for returning home (11:30pm, Friday night). <br/> I asked about a late check-out upon booking, but was told this had to be done directly at the hotel.<br/>Upon checking in to TI (Monday night), I mentioned this and I was told to call front desk at 8am (the Friday Morning of check-out).<br/> I called at 8am and they said they would allow a late check-out of 12pm, however if we wanted to have the room longer, we would have to pay for another full day and resort fee.<br/>They also wanted us to go downstairs to book this after 12pm, because they would have to make sure the room was not booked again.<br/>Which we did end up doing - But I do think this could have been mentioned to us right off the bat, Monday night. <br/> There was no need for the back and forth or guessing game of &quot;maybe I can stay later, maybe I can't&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>Overall, we really enjoyed our trip to Las Vegas and will definitely be back - <br/>But I do think we will choose a different hotel.<br/> <br/>Have a great day!! :o)	3	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

We got a great deal online, and really didn't want to pay too much for a quick girls weekend. I don't have anything horrible to say about the place. It was clean. The rooms were a good size. We had a decent view. It wasn't anything fancy, no perks, nothing to say wow, this place is amazing. We got what we paid for, and we had no complaints. <br/><br/>If pool side is your thing, well it depends on your age range. It was a youngish crowd and super packed. I don't know if anymore people could hang out in the pool, let alone swim. There were enough chairs and we never had a problem finding a place to sit. <br/><br/>Check in was easy ( a bit of a line up, but nothing crazy) we were able to take care of check out as well so we could just leave instead of having to line up for check out.	4	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

This is not optional! Room was in the 30th floor (Strip View), it was small but it was supposed to be a suite. Bed was clean but the place was not comfortable at all. We were very disappointed.

Everything was pretty good here. The only negatives were that some of the sheets and towels had small stains on them. For me, this is a big deal! Other than that, I have no complaints. It's not super glamorous, but it's not shabby at all! A great mid-range hotel at a location that I really liked. Really close to Fashion Show Mall and across from Mirage and the Wynn. I didn't check out the fitness facilities so I don't know how those are, but I heard they are good. The swimming pool looks pretty standard and I noticed from my hotel window that a good amount of people were there daily. Oh and one more gripe might be the stupid nightly resort fees, but that seems standard with the other hotels on the Strip so you can't really escape them.	4	5	-1	3	4	5	-1	4

Stayed for 7 nights.<br/><br/>Katrina on reception was great, bubbly and helpful! Got us rooms close to each other and all with Strip views, fantastic!<br/><br/>Room was large and clean, but basic facilities.<br/><br/>WiFi only available in your room.....useless as I wanted to sit at the bar and work with a mojito in my hand.<br/><br/>HUGE queue for checkout so I just left my name with a last in reception and asked them to send me to bill.<br/><br/>Bill for ?300.....for WiFi...... RIDICULOUS!!!<br/><br/>Spoke to the &quot;reception manager&quot; who had little or no people skills and told me I was charged the WiFi fee several times over as I had used various devices (phone, iPad, laptop etc) and I was charged the daily fee PER DEVICE. I explained how the girl on reception (not Katrina, another girl I spoke to the next day) said I could connect with other devices no problem for $18 per day.<br/><br/>Had to go to the hotel manager who was very helpful and agreed I would pay $25 per day.....a compromise but still not what I was told I would have to pay.<br/><br/>So beware if you want to use WiFi....I'd recommend just going to a Starbucks or something and use the wifi there.<br/><br/>Rooms were clean and the housekeeping staff were amazing. Bar staff are not really up for a laugh and a joke, maybe its just my English sense of humor but they could do with cheering up!<br/><br/>Katrina on reception was a delight so thank you to her for making check-in as pain free as possible and getting me a room with an amazing view!!<br/><br/>Breakfast at the coffee shop is a rip off for the quality (about $20 per head for average food) and the Vietnamese place in there made me ill.<br/><br/>Senior Frogs is a good laugh on a Friday night if you're in your early 20's and the Sirens show outside is worth a watch.<br/><br/>Pool closes at 6p.m.......but I turned up at 5:30 for a quick dip and was turned away.....that pool bar would get a lot of people in it if it stayed open til 9p.m as we all wanted a soak in the HUGE hot tub and a cocktail before dinner.<br/><br/>Great location and cleanliness overall....just dont expect to believe what you are told with regards to WiFi etc.	2	5	-1	4	5	3	-1	4

This was our first stay at TI and will likely be our only one.<br/><br/>The standard room is decent if a little small. The bed is comfortable if you like a soft bed (my wife does not, it hurt her back). The TV is small but the bathroom is large. The shower was nice with great water pressure and plenty of hot water. The products they give you in the bathroom are quite good. Housekeeping services were spot on, the room was cleaned well every day. The only real complaint I have about the room is the noise. The walls are thin so you can hear your neighbors very clearly and a great deal of noise leaks in though the window. We were woken up each night by sirens and one night from the train that passes behind the hotel each night and blows its horn at the intersection. <br/><br/>Checkin went well, there was no line at all at 10:30pm on a Wednesday and the front desk staff were very friendly. We asked if we could upgrade to a Petite Suite but sadly they had none available. <br/><br/>The public spaces at TI are where it lets down a little. As many many other reviews have stated the casino is VERY smokey. By the end of the trip this was bothering the both of us, if you don't smoke you probably want to avoid this casino. Other than the smoke the casino is okay, table limits are decent and they have a good slot selection (I couldn't win a dime but my wife did okay). Cocktail waitresses seemed plentiful but I never actually got a drink there. <br/><br/>The food selection is good, as are the bars. We spent time at Senior Frogs, Kahunaville, the Coffee Shop, the Buffet and the Pizzeria. Kahunaville is better then Senior Frogs, the Coffee Shop has good breakfast served till 4pm, the Pizza at the pizzeria is good New York style but the service is a little iffy, the Buffet is mediocre and bland. <br/><br/>The pool at TI is pretty small but arriving at around 10pm we had no problem finding loungers. The pool area gets lots of sun for the full day and they have an awesome little self-serve water machine by the bar. There were plenty of waitresses wandering around but I was never approached and asked if I wanted anything (I was really hungover so I would have said no but it would have been nice to be asked). The pool itself was SUPER cold but the 'hot tub' was heated to a nice temperature, it was more like a small heated pool than a hot tub but I guess that makes sense in 38C temps. <br/><br/>Overall I found TI acceptable but not exciting. For the price I paid I was perfectly happy with it but I doubt I would venture back. Location is good on the north side of the strip with plenty of hotels in walking distance. If you're a non-smoker though I'd suggest you avoid this place.	4	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

Having been to Vegas several times and stayed a a variety of hotels we chose to be mid strip( last visit we stayed at MGM and spent a fortune in cabs and too out of the way) as its by far the best location.. The original plan was to stay at MIrage as its a good location nd price and has reasonable gaming plus great bars. However some of our party got a free stay atTI with air miles and because we all wanted to stay overhear w opted for TI but were not expecting much. We were pleasantly surprised on arrival. Hotel is smaller than many but smart clean and very friendly( don't be put off by the pirate ship and dreadful sirens show - worth watching for a laugh mind you. Also se?or frog is gawdy from outside but good fun). The pool area is adequate but quite small and very busy and loud at weekends but it does have a good atmosphere. Americans seem to have taken over the stereotypical German mantle of reserving beds with towels which got a bit annoying as they used to finish or a few hours while others were looking or beds.<br/><br/>Highlights were<br/><br/> as always ballys sterling brunch- a must on a Sunday<br/>Joes seafood restaurant in Caesars <br/>Maggianos for good everyday Italian food with buzzy atmosphere<br/>Rum bar I n mirage for good outdoor drinking and cocktails<br/>Hyde in bellagio for posh pre dinner dinks and view of fountain<br/>Cheesecake factory for cheescake<br/>BLT burger in mirage for great burgers <br/>Cheap gaming downtown( worth one visit such fun)<br/><br/>We had a fabulous six nights stay and ready for next time in another four years,	5	5	-1	4	5	5	-1	5

We told the front desk and they sent up a bottle of champagne. Shaun, the server was so very nice when he delivered it, he opened the bottle and served us. What a nice man! I also ordered a rose from TI gift shop and Domenica made sure it got delivered to our room. Overall, we liked the hotel. The pool is just too small for all the people staying there. It was really crowded on the weekend; they really need to fix that. The water got cloudy right away and it was wall to wall people. You couldn't even walk in it! Be sure and get as many coupons as you can from Kahunaville, the food is really good and well worth it! Senior Frog was so much fun and Gilleys also has great barbecue food. It was a little further away from Caesars and the other famous hotels, but TI has a tram to Mirage (next door) and you can walk through Mirage to get to Caesars and the rest of the strip. Also, Elton John's show at Caesars was fantastic! Don't miss it! Next door was Fashion Show Mall-a great mall with so many stores and a lot of great shopping. If you're on a budget, this is the place.	4	4	-1	3	5	5	-1	4

On the smoking floors there was constantly butts by the elevator (we smoke but are not dirty people and deserve the same cleanliness as other floors)..on the third of four days housekeeping just plain never showed up. Dined at Gilleys and asked for a well done burger which came pink mgr came by and offered to fix it (we adre canadian and dont allow cooks the opportunity to tamper with our food by letting them bring us something else) so we passed on this, he gave us a 20% discount which was hideous. Attempted to eat at senor frogs at various times throughout the day and it was so loud in there all the time we never did go there. Several nights my husband got propositioned by prostitutes, they are everywhere at night and security just lets them continue to walk around like they dont wven notice, maybe they just dont care ? On check out the pwrson who checked me out (whose tag said she was some sort of desk mgr) did not even ask how our stay was, at the end of checking out I advised he that she should ask guests about there stay, then she asked me but didnt really care in the end. This hotel seems to have turned for the younger people given the noise level in all the restaurants etc..Sorry to see hotel with such a great location have such poor service etc..	3	4	-1	2	1	1	-1	3

My reservation was booked and prepaid through Orbitz. The hotel where the conference was held was booked out which is why I ended up at Treasure Island. Two days into the conference (May 7), I was informed that a new block of rooms were released. So I contacted the front desk at Treasure Island and asked if I can check out two days early, and Ausi (hope I didn't massacre his first name too bad) said I can check out early and a refund will come back through Orbitz. Taking his word, I went ahead, packed my bags, checked out from Treasure Island and moved to the hotel where the conference was held.<br/><br/>On Thursday May 10, I contacted Orbitz to see when would I get a refund, so they put me on hold for around 10 mins while they contacted Treasure Island. After 10 mins, they told me that Treasure Island does not do refunds and that I should go ahead and contact Treasure Island directly. So I did, I contacted the main number (702-894-7111) and after talking to them, they transferred me to the Front Desk. After talking to the Front Desk, I was transferred to the sales department. The woman in sales said that I am a customer of Orbitz, Orbitz is the one who took my money and I should talk with them. I told her I did talk to Orbitz, and they said I have to talk to the hotel which is why I'm talking to you now, but she didn't care. When I told I spoke with the guy at Front Desk and he told me not to worry and I can checkout early, she said he wasn't supposed to... However, he did. She said that's not her problem, he wasn't supposed to talk to me in the first place, go contact Orbitz, and went ahead and HUNG UP ON ME!<br/><br/>Even without that, the place is a dump. When I got there on Saturday night, they gave me a smoking room even though I had requested a non-smoking room. They moved me into a non-smoking room on Sunday, but the room didn't have any towels. When I requested towels, they didn't bring them until at least an hour later (I waited for an hour, but ended up having to leave to go to my conference, without a shower or anything). Then this whole refund fiasco happened on Monday. And don't even get me started with the stains on the bed!<br/><br/>Trust me, there are a million other hotels and motels that are better, cleaner and cheaper on the Strip and off the strip. Just avoid Treasure Island at all costs.	1	1	-1	1	1	1	-1	1

The pyrotechnics were kind of neat, and so was the sinking pirate ship - but for a &quot;family&quot; resort the show was definitely not what I would expect or recommend for that matter. Might as well take the kids to a strip club...<br/><br/>I was really hungry and a steak sounded good. Pricing was a little over the top for the appearance of this hole in the wall place. Very snobbish for a place that really has no reason to be. I asked for a booth against the back wall, seriously two steps from the table I was offered and was told that that section was not open tonight because things were too slow. Well, sorry, but if I'm getting attitude like this before I even sit down - guess what. I'm gone. See ya. Really wish I had stopped to eat at Japonais at the Mirage when I was there a bit earlier in the evening. If I'm going to spend $50 plus for a steak - well lets just say that Japonais has the class to go along with the price!	1	-1	-1	-1	2	-1	-1	-1

We had a great time at the hotel. The rooms were clean and modern. The bathroom was beautiful--large tub, nice vanity, very luxurious. Our view was terrific--we were on the 30th floor (top) and had a great view of the strip--could see the volcano at the Mirage go off at night. We could also see the mountains in the day from our room. It was just great. The beds and pillows were so comfortable, as I'd read. Everything was clean and neat in the hotel. We requested a nonsmoking room and so that was great. And the hotel helped us to get 3 rooms right near each other, which isn't always easy. <br/>Everyone we met from the front desk to the waitresses and housekeeping were friendly and helpful. When we first got there at the front desk, we met the nicest woman named Susan whose nametag said &quot;Long Island, NY&quot;. That is where we are from and so we chatted and she was so nice as to make sure we got our rooms together, gave us suggestions on where to eat, what to see, etc. She went out of her way to make us feel at home! She was from a town just 10 minutes away from us. But I could see she was just as kind and helpful to everyone, and not just because we were fellow Long Islanders. I would recommend this casino/hotel to all. The food was great at the buffet and at Kahunaville. Cirque de Soleil Mystere was awesome and right at this hotel.	5	4	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

The resort fee at TI is the same as Beallagio at $25 per night which is ridiculous considering the Bellagio is a significantly better hotel. The TI pool is one of the smallest on the strip and on weekends you can not even get a chair unless you get there early. The pool itself is crowded and way too small for the size of the hotel making it a ridiculous experience. The Casino has gone downhill and the poker room is one of the worst in Vegas with not a single person in there for most of the day. The &quot;Sirens of TI&quot; Pirate show went from decent a few years ago to terrible. It has gone from a pirate show to more of a stripper show and was hugely dissapointing. The hotel staff are not exactly overly friendly which you would expect from a better hotel. The buffet at TI was pretty bad compared ot others close by. For similar pricing go to the Mirage/Planet Hollywood or Bellagio and get a significantly better buffet. The room itself was comfortable and nice but that was the only nice thing about the hotel which is unfortunate as when you are in Vagas the room itself is one of the least important things. I have been to Vegas many times and stayed and significantly cheaper hotels with much better facilities such as Monte Carlo, etc... This hotel has gone downhill ever since MGM sold it off which is unfortunate as it used to be decent.	1	4	-1	4	4	2	-1	4

Stayed in a basic room once and a suite the other night. Obviously the suite was better but it was facing the side of the pool so the bar bumped music until late in the night. Basic room was small and cramped. <br/><br/>If you have been here years ago you will notice the 'TI&quot; makeover. Guess they are trying to attract the young and hip crowd? If that's the goal this is still not the place to be?.Checked expedia recently and noticed this hotel is more expensive than Mandalay Bay. I was shocked! Rooms are a tad better than Monte Carlo but that isn't saying much. Rooms are still tiny and casino is cramped and very smokey. Poor ventilation. You'll notice a difference when you go from hotel to hotel. Encore has a similar issue but MGM and Mandalay Bay aren't anywhere near as bad. Pool is average and food is whatever. Walls are also pretty thin here. <br/><br/>End of the day if this property is in the same price category as the other 4 stars it isn't worth it. By no means is this location bad but there are just so many options now in Vegas you really need to be unique these days. I would say this is a weak 4 star but definitely a step above the 3 stars on the strip	2	3	-1	2	4	4	-1	3

Neither one of us are gamblers or drinkers but Vegas has some nice shows too. We went to see Jersey Boys at Paris and it was amazing. The customer service at TI is very 50/50. The people at the front desk were always smiley and helpful. We did alot of coming and going from Valet (trust me you don't want to have to park yourself) and spent over $100 in tipping in 3 days, yet 1/2 of the valets were not very pleasant. It wasn't that hot out yet which I know can get grueling in the summer. We live in AZ so I understand. Aks for a lower floor or you'll spend alot of time on the elevetor waiting for people to stop. My biggest gripe, no security anywhere and ALOT of prostitution (though I know it's legal there) and drug deals going down in the elevators. It was very disheartening. I do appreciate that you can walk from valet to the elevator without too much smoke and 2 malls are within walking distance. Dissappointed by the decor but then maybe that's why their not quite as pricey. We chose to eat at Bahama Breeze which is not in the strip of casinos but they have great food.	3	5	-1	4	4	3	-1	4

Finally our turn and the desk agent noticed that my birthday was the next day,she told me that T I considered birthdays extra special and looked at them as an opportunity to make a guest for life, so she upgraded us to the 28th floor with a strip view,and a free bottle of champagne, I slipped her a $20 for her kindness and we were on our way to start Vegas.....untill we get to the 28th floor,find our room and realize that this was a regular room, not the Petite suite that we had paid for, NBD, I will just call down and they will get the room switched and send the bell staff up to help with the move, wrong. I was told to come back down with my travel documents to show them the type of room that was paid for, so I haul back down to the dask and hand the paperwork to the manager and wait, and wait some more until he hands me keys to a room on the 4th floor and says have a nice stay. Okay, back to 28th floor, grab all of our crap, head to 4th floor, right room this time, look out window to see the lovely view of the A/C units, dont like view of A/C units, call desk again, ask what happend to all of that crap about wanting me to have a special birthday at T I and be a life long guest, told that Petite suites dont have a strip view, I beg to differ because I can see the top of the Mirage above the A/C units, if I were higher up I would have a strip view, told I could have my regular room back on 28th floor, decide to no longer pursue the matter. Next morning after a long night in Vegas the wife wants to have a nice soak in the tub, jets dont work, should have stayed in regular room, never got them working, never got our champagne, never got a view, but even after that long rant, you really cant beat the place for the money, great location, great party places, good room, depending on budget, I would stay again and recomend	4	5	-1	3	4	3	-1	5

The room was nicely appointed with comfortable beds and a large bathroom. My first complaint is in the assignment of rooms. I made my reservation in January requesting a non-smoking king bed room. I paid my deposit as they required. They do note on the reservation that preferences are not guaranteed. Why not?? They took my money but I did not get a king be as requested. I was not happy about that.<br/> The hotel charges a resort fee as most LV hotels do. They give you a card stating what the resort fee is for. One of the items listed is wireless internet. The internet access was terrible we could connect to the wireless network but could never get to a web page. If they have the nerve to charge you extra and state that is what you are paying for, it should work.<br/> We never received housekeeping services. We were gone from our room from 9AM-1PM, and 4PM-10PM, ample time for housekeeping to clean our room. When I returned at 10PM and they had not done that, I immediately called housekeeping and told them my room had not been serviced. They offered to send someone down to clean and I told them I only needed clean towels (we had barely been in the room, it really wasn't dirty) which they delivered 45 minutes and a second phone call later. The overall hotel is lovely, but I have received housekeeping service, the room I reserved and internet access that works at less expensive hotels that do not charge a resort fee. Would I stay there again? Maybe, but would probably look elsewhere.	3	4	-1	3	4	2	-1	4

Also, with regards to location, it is close to excellent shopping in the Fashion Show Mall (in fact, it is connected to TI via pedway). I traveled with friends, and the hotel was accommodating and put us in rooms proximate to each other. Very impressed with the front desk service (efficient) and the housekeeping service (did a fantastic job). The only reason I didn't stay at TI last time I went to Vegas was because we were seeking a suite, as there were more of us travelling. TI is highly recommended, however.

My friend and I were staying together in 1 room. We weren't with a group. I went to get ready for bed, and low and behold, my Collectable Mickey Mouse (purchased from Disney in December 2012) pj pants were missing. The room was turned upside down not just once, but twice. I checked my friend's luggage, checked EVERYWHERE and they were no where to be found.<br/><br/>I called hotel security who advised me to contact them in the morning if they did not turn up. I contacted them in the morning, and a security officer promptly arrived to take my statement etc. He indicated at that time that if they were accidentally mixed in with the laundry it would be likely I would never see them again and the hotel would reimburse me. I took some splice in this because I wanted to try to replace these.<br/><br/>I followed up with hotel security at least once during my 7 day stay, and nothing. When I got home, I followed up with hotel security who advised me that there was no indication that the pj pants went to the laundry and therefore there would be no reimbursement.<br/><br/>I was furious! I explained that if they didn't go with the laundry (which is done off site) then they were taken from my room (from the dresser drawer I might add), and I wanted reimbursement. Security said that they would call back. They never did. Today I got a letter in the mail from them stating that they would not reimburse me.<br/><br/>The hotel did not address my complaints about our room (the smell of #2 that would be present in our room every afternoon, nor the maintenance problems - shorting out power bar outlets etc. <br/><br/>Even the people at the TI player's club didn't know what the heck they were doing in terms of signing people up and giving them the proper amount of credit etc.<br/><br/>This was my first time to Las Vegas!

The hotel was just ok. It needs a major renovation. We were suppose to have a room with a King bed but upon check in there were none available and ended up with 2 Queens. The room was sort of clean but if you really look around the edges of the rug and the bath it needs to be cleaner. The bathroom had a single sink and was poorly lit. The vanity mirror light didn't work. I plugged in the hairdryer and the lights went out. I guess I tripped the switch. Maintenance tried to come in my room to fix something in the shower after I had just gotten out of the shower. I had no idea they were coming and good thing I had the latch across the back of the door because he tried to enter using his key. I told him I was all set. Don't like the idea of anyone except for maid service coming into my room without me knowing. If something needs to be fixed you wait until your guest leaves and the room is empty.The casino was just ok. I did get two comp dinners but when I actually got them it wasn't really for 2 free dinners. It was for up to 20 dollars a person. Not much with how expensive it is to eat. Actually I paid for at least 2 free dinners with the amount of money I dropped in their casino. The buffet was ok, the other restaurant was not so good...but it did have the biggest potato I have ever seen! Francescos pizza was really good. The vending machine on our floor was broken. The other vending machine on the same floor had no water ( which is very important when it is 105 degrees out). There was no coffee pot in the room which would be a nice thing to have. We had a fridge, but not a stocked fridge. We got a note from management saying they were sorry we were not happy with the room and gave us a fruit basket which was nice and two bottles of Figi water? I don't know how they knew that because we didn't complain... ??? They were going to have turn down service for us each night. I guess my husband did get turn down service the night before he left (one night) I used a glass to have a drink and the dirty glass remained for 3 days ...I kept waiting to see if the cleaning person would take it..but nope... I had take the iron out to iron a few things and thought the cleaning person would put it back..nope..it stayed out for 3 days. Seemed like they did the minimal in cleaning. The only good thing I can say about this hotel is that the beds were comfortable. I went to the pool area one day with a glass of sprite and ice and was told I couldn't bring it to the pool area and had to dump it. That pissed me off....Why??? because they want you to buy a drink at the pool because it's 102 degrees out $$$$. They really need a total renovation. I know they will read this and not be happy so listen to your customers...you need a total renovation! The entrance doors look very dirty. I would not go back. Ohh, there is a Walgreens across the street to get water, etc. On another note. A great place to eat that had really good food and was reasonable was the Grand Lux Cafe at the Venetian. We went to see the Beatles Love at the Mirage. It was good, not great. My favorite hotels were: the Bellagio (the valet area where the cars drove up actually shined...like it was polished daily..it was immaculate). Cesear's Palace is one of my favorites. We walked to the Cosmopolitan which I really liked. It was very Chic! The Venetian is nice and I really liked the Winn. Mr. Winn wants to put a Casino in Massachusetts. Have got to tell you he did a really classy job on his hotel in Vegas! I went to Sigfried and Roy's Secret Garden where they had dolphins and some of the white tigers. It was small but for 20 bucks it was worth it. I enjoyed that a lot. There are no deals in Vegas. It is very expensive to go to a show, to eat and to stay. We wanted to go see Terry Factor the Vantrilaquest? (sp)? But for 2 good tickets it would have been about 400 bucks...we thought that was a bit much to watch someone play with puppets. So bring lots of money! Although I didn't like Treasure Island, I had a great time but it's probably my last trip to Vegas. P.S. I won at the Airport!! Go Figure!!	2	3	-1	3	2	3	-1	5

The rooms are clean but the resort will also charge you double for everything. The pool is really small for such a large resort and a poolside beer is $7 AND closed in the evening, that includes the hot tub. There are no movie channels and no confirmation screens when looking at ppv so you get charged for movies even if you don't watch them, no exceptions. Then the fact that there is no coffee in the rooms is a deal breaker for me. We were forced to buy coffee in the lobby's Starbucks that was actually Pikes Place coffee at double the normal cost of a Starbucks coffee. We will not be going back.	1	3	-1	3	5	3	-1	4

We booked the tv ad special directly from their website so we didn't have to pay the 25 dollar per day resort fee. Check in was smooth and we did not have to wait in line as many other people have mentioned. The girl at the front desk was friendly and efficient. The room offers a small flat screen tv, basic toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and body wash) which are replenished daily. There is a hair dryer on the top shelf in the closet. The room was clean and the cleaning staff was especially friendly. Our room was cleaned promptly and thoroughly each day. The furniture shows a little wear, but was still fine for us. The location is in great proximity to all the action in Vegas. We were given 2 for 1 buffet coupons, but didn't use them so I can't comment on the quality of the food. We went to Gilleys and used our 2 for 1 draft beer coupon. It was a nice atmosphere and service was good. We never had to wait for a drink. We were given a nice view of the strip on the 7th floor even though we did not request it. It would've been nice to be higher, but we weren't in the room enough to make it a priority. We spent one day at the pool. It was crowded but we didn't have any trouble finding chairs or getting drinks. The pool is small by Vegas standards but it was nice and we enjoyed it very much. There is a bit of a party atmosphere but nothing over the top. Everyone appeared to be having fun! We ate lunch by the pool at Kahaunaville. The waitress was a bit slow to seat us and not very friendly, but the food was pretty good and reasonably priced. At night, security checks for room keys as you enter the elevator which some people found annoying, but I appreciated the safety factor. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to my friends and family as long as they are offering the tv ad special. If I had to pay the resort fee, I would probably pick someplace else just to try something different. All in all, our stay at Treasure Island was a very pleasant one.	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1

I have done 9 conferences and we decided to do one here and I would never do it again at TI. While it wasn't a horrible experience, it was surely the worse experience versus all eight other conferences we did at other hotels.<br/><br/>First of all, they seemed to never trust us with anything when it came to money, and trying multiple times to charge us more than what we agreed - always backing down when we showed documentation. When it came to rates, they seemed to always have conflicting rates with their online booking engines that were in conflict with an agreed rate for us causing a tremendous amount of extra work for us.<br/><br/>The rooms - well - horrible. The original room I was in, the table had so much rust underneath the glass, it was just plain gross. The furniture was extremely beaten.<br/><br/>When we went into the Executive Suite ... I spent some time myself washing the marks off the doors and walls. The air-conditioning vent had not been changed in years and crud was just blowing off from it. We called hosuekeeping and maintenance changed out the vendor after three tries. He simply changed out the a/c filter, and I had to then clean the vent myself. The desk had water between the desk and glass and it ate away the paint. The fridge in the room had all the shelves in backwards and so we took the mini-fridge out ourselves and fixed all of the shelves. There was hair in the sink and the vanities ... but it didn't surprise me. The housekeeping was just plain horrible - I'm sure they just simply do not have an Executive Housekeeping or Floor Supervisor really checking on the staff. Housekeeping was beyond poor.<br/><br/>As for checking in, my staff took 65 minutes to checkin which was between 5PM and 6:05PM. There were two desk clerks on the entire time (seriously?!) and one of them spent a lot of time checking one person in, and then walking away from the desk for five minutes and then coming back. You'd think a hotel checking in 100 people in an hour would put more than 2 people on the desk. That alone was just plain unnecessary in this economy when people are looking for jobs.<br/><br/>The responses from all our attendees was FAIR to POOR and all seemed to say the same thing. It wasn't uncommon to see junk on the carpet in the hallways either...again...housekeeping really didn't seem to have a 'ownership' attitude.<br/><br/>By the way - don't pick up the phone. Picked up the phone and dialed a cell phone just to see if it would ring (ie: less than minute call as the folio shows 000 minutes) - $12.60 <br/><br/>Housekeeping and front desk is really the worse part of this hotel. <br/><br/>I personally would not recommend it for a large group/convention because of the great number of issues we had constantly. It most definitely was the worse convention I've ever planned compared to eight other hotels.	3	3	-1	2	1	2	-1	3

The reason we chose this property was because of its great location and reasonably priced rooms. When we arrived at around 2:30pm on a Saturday afternoon, the line for check-in was somewhat long, but this was expected given the time of day. We read this tip that we found online where you sandwich a $20 bill between your license and credit card and ask for any complimentary upgrades. So, we decided to give it a try, and it worked like a charm. Our room was originally a standard deluxe room, but we were upgraded to a tower deluxe room (essentially the same room but higher ceilings) on the penthouse floor, a strip view, and a free bottle of champagne. It was definitely $20 well spent, and we think the front desk representative certainly appreciated the tip. Once we got up to our room, we were pretty happy except for a few small issues. There was someone else's takeout food left in our fridge (kinda gross), our air conditioner was rather noisy, and our iPod docking station was not working properly. However, the beds were quite comfortable, and the view was spectacular. To save money on food, drinks, and alcohol, we took the bus to a Vons about 15 minutes away and stored everything in the fridge. It worked out very well and was actually much more convenient than buying food every day. In terms of the rest of the property, there were definitely a lot of things that could be improved. The casino was pretty small compared to other resorts on the strip, and there were not that many table games available. In addition, the poker room was an absolute joke with no more than one or two tables ever going on at the same time. Make sure you sign up for the Players Club because you get at least $10 in free slot play. I got $15 and ended up cashing out at $17 (wooo big money). We got drinks at both of the Starbucks on the property, and the prices were a little higher than your typical Starbucks. On our last night there, we ate at Isla, the Mexican restaurant. You get unlimited free chips and salsa with your meal, and we were able to use our 2 for 1 drink coupon that we got upon checking in. However, I did not really like my meal, but my friend enjoyed his. Our best meal was actually at a restaurant at the Fashion Show Mall next door. There was this place called RA Sushi that had great sushi and drink specials after 8pm on Sundays. We would highly recommend it. Furthermore, probably one of the most disappointing aspects of the resort was the ridiculously small pool. For having almost 2,900 rooms, we could not believe the property would have a pool of that size. Also, it was primarily filled with drunk people, so it was not really enjoyable to be in. Another issue we encountered was that we had to print something, and it costs $10 just to use the computer for the minimum amount of time plus $1.50 for each page printed. We thought this was pretty ridiculous, so we asked the front desk if they could just print something out for us instead. Their response was that they were supposedly unable to access the internet from their computers. However, we went down to the business center the next day, and the guy behind the counter was nice enough to print it out for free. Lastly, we saw the Sirens of TI show and were pretty unimpressed. It was terrible acting and just not that entertaining, but no worries because it was free. Overall, the majority of the staff were nice although they never went out of their way to be all that friendly. We would consider staying at this property again just for the sleep quality, the price, and location if we ever came back to Vegas, but there are definitely other resorts that have a lot more to offer with regard to entertainment.	5	5	-1	4	4	3	-1	5

Treasure Island was recommended by a friend and so I was expecting a very decent hotel. The location itself is great and the overall hotel was good with the shops, pool and eateries. However, the room itself was a big disappointment. My 4 day/3 night stay was supposed to include a deluxe suite, 2 queen beds and free wireless. The pictures on the website were lovely. The first impression were the 2 FULL size beds being pedaled as Queens, no coffee machine or bathrobe and no wireless access. The room, which was for smokers, was small and the bathroom was nice but the sink repeatedly clogged up with just the water running. My overall rating for this hotel is eh...my experience was so-so. Not really bad....not really good....eh. The casino was great, the pool had a D.J. and had adequate room for the crowd...very enjoyable. Would I stay there again? I seriously don't know, price and location would have a lot to do with it and I would at least know what I was getting into. But still I DID VEGAS...WHOO HOOOOOOOO!

Arrived around 10am, check in starts at 11. At 11:15, I stood in line for 30 minutes watching 4 people check in about 40 of us. Staff was friendly enough, but they didn?? ask if I had been to Vegas before and didn?? offer any information like other hotels do, they just assume you know what?? going on and send you on your way. I like that certain elevators go to certain floors, otherwise it would??e taken forever anytime we needed to get up to our room on the 32nd floor. We were in room 32041, facing the Fashion Show Mall. The view rocked ?you can see the mountains in the distance, it was beautiful. Rooms are quite soundproof, sure you hear people yelling in the hallways, or the ambulance sirens outside, but other than that, it was fine, and I?? a very light sleeper. The beds are comfortable, if you are sleeping along. If there's 2 of you in their &quot;queen-size&quot;, it's TIGHT. They are not standard queens - weirdest sized beds I've ever seen. They were like a large double. And very short - if you are over 5'4, good luck. Weird. Maybe we booked the pre-teen room and didn't realize it?? The rooms are standard, nothing fancy. Last year we stayed at Mirage. We prefer Mirage. There aren?? many take out options at TI (though we did pay $8 for grilled cheese at Carnegie Deli one night). Mirage has California Pizza Kitchen ?the BEST pizza and pasta and fabulous staff!! We made the trek over to Mirage numerous times just to get food. Some bath towels were like sandpaper, others were newer and softer. We always had 4 towels, so if one felt rough, we?? toss it on the floor and move onto the next one. Housekeeping was ok, not great. One day they didn?? come at all. Perhaps they stop after a certain time, we left the room around 1:30 that day. One day, they took the duvet and didn?? return it until we asked for it. What was that?! As for the ??esort fee? for this reason alone we will never return. Included in this fee is a daily paper ?never saw a single one. Access to the gym ?after walking the strip for hours each day, we didn?? need the gym (this should be an optional fee, and guests who pay for it given an access card or something, but not fair for those of us not interested to have to pay for it). The rooms don?? have coffee makers, an almost basic necessity when it comes to hotels nowadays. And the coupons were of no interest to us ?like 2-4-1 during happy hour at a place we have no interest in. The resort fee is simply TIs way of advertising lower prices, while nailing you on checkout. As for the Wi-Fi, it to is included in the resort fee, but it is slow and spotty at times. The casino itself is so so. I don?? gamble but the overall look of the place is a bit run down and dingy. As for the pool, I was only out there one day, other days I was at the bigger pool parties. The DJ is there until 5, he plays pretty good music. It?? a smaller pool, but I can?? say much about it as the day we were there, it was so insanely windy, no one was enjoying anything. But, it definitely has potential. They didn?? check mine or my friends bags but when a guy came in, they did check him and wouldn?? let him bring his water bottle in. I saw Mystere and the Titanic exhibit at Luxor (see separate reviews). Overall, when it comes down to TI versus Mirage, Mirage wins hands down and I will go back there next year.	2	5	-1	3	3	3	-1	4

Knowing that we would arrive late in the afternoon and leave ealy next morning we did not want to spend the money for a 5* hotel and the price was fair for a saturday night rate.<br/><br/>The check-in around 6 pm took us about 30 min and we had a nice view to the strip from our room window. The room was clean and we had enough space to repack and organize all our suitcases. Bathroom was clean and renovated, too.<br/><br/>The location was good for the northern part of the strip and we knew we could see the main part later when we would stay for another 3 nights. Tired from our 24 hour trip from Brazil to the US we only walked for a short time, down to Cesars Palace, passing The Venetian and The Mirage, so location was quite good.<br/><br/>All in all I can recommend the Treasure Island for everybody who is looking for an average priced Las Vegas Hotel in a central location to the strip.	3	4	-1	4	4	3	-1	4

The resort fee does kill the great price you get to begin with--plus there is additional tax added onto the fee. The hotel has a great location rather mid-strip. The rooms were very good, clean, and more then adequate for the time spent in them. No complaints about the rooms. I found the hotel to have way to many &quot;rules&quot; for me but that is probably standard in Las Vegas. You do receive several buy one get one free drink coupons and 2 free buffet dinner/lunch but could not be used for breakfast? Breakfast was a buy one get one free coupon which we used. The breakfast was very good and worth it. Didn't get that--also the pool rules are insane. You cannot bring a cup into the pool unless it is from there one bar. If you want to use your buy one get one free coupon you cannot order from the pool alhtough it is the only drink you are allowed to bring into the area that drink must come from the bar directly then walk past the &quot;pool police&quot; as he checks to make sure it was Kahuaville on it? If he is not there many people have starbucks etc. if he is there--no way. It all depends on who is there at the time minding the store. The restaurants are very pricy and for breakfast there is a Denny's across the street which we went to more often. There is a mexican restaurant that had happy hour at the bar but not inside the restaruant a few steps away. Another rule. I would avoid that place as it was not good Mexican food at all!! There is a senior Frogs attached and it was good and a fun place. I would also advise strongly against bringing any valuables to the pool area. I was told my an international traveler she dunked herself was gone for 3 minutes and her handbag containing travel documents, I.D and all cash stolen from pool area. I would think one would have left these items in the safe, but beware. I am sure in las Vegas this is a common occurance According to her the staff at TI was not that helpful to her. it was an &quot;oh well&quot; . Some people are not comfortable using a safe either but that is what I do when I travel. All in all it was an ok place not any problems for me. As one poster said I have stayed at the Mirage and the pool area at the Mirage is 100 times more desirable than TI. If interested in using a pool then I would choose Mirage next door. Not much shade at TI either. If I return I will also stay at the Mirage.	4	5	-1	4	5	4	-1	4

The room are very well appointed, clean and quiet. The beds are heavenly. They recently opened a Senior Frog restaurant and bar. This is a very lively place that will appeal to a wide audience. <br/><br/>The pool is small but the crowd gives it a good vibe. They added mattresses on top of the chair which is a nice thing to do but still, you can only get 1 towel which is way too short to cover the whole chair. Not nice to touch the sticky chair with your legs. They also replaced the DJ that has been there forever which is a very good thing. <br/><br/>The only negative that I would point out is the casino floor is ready for an overhaul. Compared with the other casino, their game offer is limited and do not turn around frequently. They do have new games added but it?? not enough, you still have the same floor layout and games found in the same spot for years. Odds are not the best also, I see to win ever where except there which is a bug since I like so much the hotel. I would recommend the place for the 18-40 yo crowd.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Thee is an evening show in front of the hotel, and would say, this too is a must see. The Hotel is located right beside a Mall, and the Starbucks prices are better here than in the hotel. The hotel is about as far North, as I would like to go on the strip, but we were able to walk to most of the other hotels from there. We purchased the $7.00 bus pass, which was good for a 24 hour period, so went to the North and South Outlet Malls, as well as to Freemont Street, where we enjoyed chocolate covered bananas for $1.00. We did a day tour to the Hoover Dam, which I would also recommend.	4	4	-1	5	4	4	-1	5

The rooms were lovely. check in/out took quite a while even though it was quiet at the time. The casino floor area can be very busy at times, so if you have small children like we did, keep them close, as you have to walk through this area after getting the lifts down from the rooms to get o the exits/entrances. Children are not allowed on the gaming table/ slot machine area but can stand on the walkways! we did not play whilst we had the children. The views from the rooms are awesome we opted for a high floor. The pool area is very nice and there is the option to pay for a cabana which is a great idea for when it's too hot. I appreciate Vegas is aimed at adults but we went with children (as we were on a touring Holiday) and other than the pool there was not much else for them. They did however enjoy the sights and sounds of Vegas! A must is the hotel outdoor shows.	4	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

The 1st night we were put on the 3rd floor, this overlooked the strip but bing so low you could only see the flat roof of the hotel, there was a lot of noise from the air con unit, the next morning i requested a move and we were moved to the 20 something floor (a lot quieter), we also had a good view looking down onto the strip.<br/>This hotel is undegoing some updating, however this does not cause any issues.<br/>Our holiday ended just as hoards were arriving for spring break, looks like it could have got a bit lively......	5	4	-1	5	5	4	-1	4

How many people have traveled and had to indure rock hard, uncomfy beds? The beds at Treasure Island are so cloud comfy that one day I didn't get up until noon (and I went to bed early). My mom and I forced ourselves to get up. My mom said &quot;well, I guess it's noon, we should probably get up&quot; lol! They actually sell their beds through the website (brand news ones of course). The rooms have very attractive modern decor and the hotel is right beside the Fashion Show Mall for easy shoping access. It is also right across from the awesome Wynn hotel. My only negative would be that the pool seems small but we never used it while there. If you want an amazing sleep in a very nice hotel room for a very reasonable price, stay here! PS - Stayed here in 2007 so the pics are a bit old. The beds have different comforters now I believe.	5	3	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

Without asking for an upgrade, our room was on the strip side overlooking the Sirens Cove. Amazing view of the area from the 24th floor.

The hotel is very nice (I like it better than MGM as it is not as large - hence less walking to get from point A to point B of the hotel). Free monorail to Mirage is nice. Se?or Frogs right on property is a plus. Very active and fun place and you can just go &quot;up to your room&quot; instead of going off to another hotel. The other bar featuring cowgirls and a mechanical bull is also fun - free line dancing lessons, beer pong, lively place and, again, you don't need to &quot;go back to your hotel&quot; as you ARE in your hotel. It is not the Caesars or the Wynn by any means, but a good hotel at a decent price. Casino is, like most, smokey, but the crowd is better than the Rio by far. Poker room has daily tournaments at $50.00 and usually about 1 to two tables, but not more during my stay. Skyway bridge and being right across the street from the Fashion Mall were a plus (read: mall food court = less expensive than hotel food). If you're going to be out until after 11:00 p.m., you're fine, but if you are one of those who goes to Vegas to go to sleep before 10:00 p.m., don't get a room on the strip as the Pirates/Sirens show in front of the hotel is loud and you'll hear the yelling and fireworks from your room ont he 33rd floor about three to four times per night.	4	5	-1	3	4	3	-1	4

After our stay in July 2011 we didn't think we would stay there again, as other hotels have more appeal to us. We had family who were staying here, so decided to stay again. <br/><br/>We got in at around 1:30 PM, and the check in line was not long. We had booked for a Strip View room, and asked for a high floor. The girl was very nice, and told us we would be happy with our room. We went up to our room and were surprised and annoyed that it was not the view we had paid for. <br/><br/>We went back down and the girl who had helped us was gone. We stood in line, which went quickly, and this time got a nice young man. We explained we had paid for a Strip View, but were not given one. I also said, with a big smile, that last year we had stayed in a corner room, and would love to have one again. He said that the corner rooms were very popular, and usually there were not any available. He typed away, and said that he had found us one! The room was 30036. Last year we had stayed in 29036. So, we were one floor higher. <br/><br/>The room was basic, clean, VERY comfy bed and pillows. The tub is deep, so nice to soak in at the end of the day. The view was amazing. From one window we could see the pool, the mountains, Rio, Palms, and the Strip all the way to Mandalay Bay. Out of the other window we could see Palazzo, Venetian and all down the Strip to Mandalay Bay as well. We were very happy with the room. <br/><br/>The housekeeping was excellent, the room always nice and clean when we returned in the afternoons. There is a resort fee of $25 a day, and we did not use any of the amenities. We never bothered to get the &quot;free newspaper&quot; as we had to go down to casino level and search it out. We like the location of the hotel, as we can quickly get to Fashion Show Mall and some of our favorite restaurants. Stripburger, Peppermill and Maggiano's are all close. We also like Ross, and that is walking distance as well (a long walk). There is a Walgreens right across the street, and a tram that goes to Mirage. <br/><br/>I did book a treatment at the spa, and the customer service was so poor that I would never go back.<br/><br/>We did enjoy our stay, and have decided that if the price is right, we would stay here again.	5	4	-1	4	4	5	-1	5

We book our stay last year (2011) at Flamingo two months in advance and a month later we received a comped room offer from TI. So, last minute- I mean very last minute- it was July 1st and we called TI and booked for July 2nd and 3rd(we were transferring to Flamingo for the 4th to the 11th). They actually had A ROOM AVAILABLE. Yes! Flamingo wanted 400 for these two days and I got it for 125 at TI. Awesome. So, we hate switching rooms , but gave this place a try. Before this I almost never went to TI. We only went to Dos Caminos(RIP) to eat and played a little. Now, here are the basics of what we found useful to know about TI.<br/>* It has a separate player's card- and the free play actually comes pretty quickly compared with CET or MGM.<br/>* The rooms were actually really nice compared with Harrah's, Flamingo, Palms, Planet Hollywood. We had a pool view, which we liked because then we knew when it was busy or not<br/>* The pool is much better than most. It has a DJ on most days and it quite large and good for tanning. BUT, it is kid friendly, which can be a good or bad thing. Bad for me, but maybe good for you if you are bringing the family.<br/>* Great variety of newer games. It is quite large. BUT, several days it seemed they comped many, many people so there were overflowing places.<br/>* Check in is the worst I have ever experienced in my life. - I am a very frequent hotel guest for &quot;leisure&quot; , not business. I have taken 16 trips to VEgas and never had issues, and I expect 20-30 people in front of me from staying at PH so often. Now, this place was an absolute nightmare. There were at least 50 people in front of us. It took almost two hours to check in. It got so bad my gf and I rotated letting the other person have a break and wander around!!! Be prepared.<br/>* The restaurants are great. Many choices, but they shut down Dos Caminos- my favorite place!!<br/>* The pirate Show is cool, but gets very overcrowded. I saw- several times- parents getting a bit crazy due to the fact their kid could not see. They were shouting at people , ect... not fun.<br/>* Up strip location. I like to be center strip- i.e.- Planet Hollywood, Cosmo... and this is a bit up strip for me.<br/>After our stay we returned many times- habit I guess. But, we do like this place that we once overlooked. Good Luck in Vegas!!	3	2	-1	4	4	1	-1	4
UR131433562	708F6B5208DBF448ED6C6502B351B1E2	Treasure Island - TI Hotel & Casino	Las_Vegas_Nevada	2012-06-06	Ok, not great, customer service has walked the plank	3	0	TI remains one of the better all round offers for staying on The Strip as long as you're prepared to accept poorer service levels. <br/>TI is located at the far north end of the central run of resort hotel/casinos. A tram link is provided to neighbouring (and former sister property) The Mirage, which is handy as it saves some shoe leather on the long walk to the main part of the action (and also makes it easier to escape one of the worst casinos on the strip, or at least one where I never seem to have much luck!).<br/>The rooms are fine if nothing special, If you're looking for a luxury stay then you'd feel more at home at the Wynn/Encore across the street (at three times the budget). If you'd rather spend your money on other things in Vegas and are prepared to walk (and walk) then TI is a good option, particularly as it tends to offer lower rates for busy dates than the more polished hotels. <br/>Having said that the property has been on the slide for years (check out, or rather don't, the beyond awful Sirens of TI show running every night outside the hotel - that and Senor Frogs is the tacky face of the current TI) and the service is anything but four star. <br/>Stayed in May 2012 and on checkin was told &quot;I've given you a nice room away from the highway -you don't want to be there as the noise goes on all night&quot; - get to the room and I'm right on the corner closest the busy main road! (note, not the strip, the intersection to the freeway). Why lie about it, what was to be gained? Then, despite several calls, the door to my room was not working properly throughout my stay (having to swipe a keycard 30/40 times to get into your room gets old real fast!) promises that security would be up to fix it never came to anything. Just feels like the management are running things on the cheap nowadays. If everywhere else is busy or you can get a very good price, book it. Otherwise, there are better Vegas options.	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1

Not being used to this, I couldn't believe how far we had to walk to get to the elevator from the parking lot and then to our room once we left the elevator! Rooms were very nice but too costly for me to stay again. Our view was of a back parking lot. If you go there to gamble this room would be great, but if you want to see the strip, be prepared for walking a long way.	2	3	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

But after reflection I realised, it's more that I don't like Las Vegas that much. The things that bothered me about the TI are the same things that bother me about Vegas in general, so perhaps it's not fair to blame the hotel for this.<br/><br/>First the positive: the hotel is located on the central part of the Strip, close to all other major casinos and hotels. The rooms are large and I slept very well. Airco is important in Las Vegas and it worked well. I got a room with a view over the Strip, which was nice. The bathroom is excellent. Check in took quite a long time, but that was mostly because there was a line of people. Once it was my turn, everything was quick, easy and professional.<br/><br/>On the negative side: guests are allowed to smoke in the casino, which I personally find disgusting. If you are a smoker, that's a plus for you of course :) You need to walk through the casino to get to your room, so it's hard to avoid.<br/><br/>You get nickeled and dimed for everything. They charge a large resort fee. Later I understood that's usual for Las Vegas, but I found it ridiculous and pointless. Just include it in the price for the room.<br/><br/>The WiFi works well and is supposedly free. But it's just part of the &quot;fee&quot;, so I guess I actually paid $25/day for it. Also, don't try to connect an iPad or smartphone next to your laptop, because then you pay through the nose.<br/><br/>I used the business center for 90 seconds (logging in to gmail and printing 3 pages) and got charged $15. Pretty close to fraud if you ask me. <br/><br/>There is no breakfast, but there are a couple of places next to the casino where you can have a meal, so that's not really an issue. Although of course: an omelet and a coffee will be $20 or more.<br/><br/>I don't gamble, so I can't comment on the casino.<br/><br/>Considering this is a Las Vegas hotel, I suppose this hotel is as good as it gets. That doesn't mean I liked it though.	3	4	-1	4	4	3	-1	4

Unfortunately for us there was a convention on in the hotel when we arrived and the queue to check in was massive - after a 30 minute wait the hotel did not have our reservations, even though we had the paper work, and would not give us a room without us paying again. We spent the first night phoning the UK and our travel agent trying to sort it out - the next day the hotel said they had now received the infomation and refunded the money... not a good start (but not the hotels fault but they could have handled it better). The pool of this hotel is quite small compared to the room numbers - and if the hotel is busy or it's a college holiday in the USA it is 'hell' (I'm sure fun for the youth amoungst us)..you couldn't swim in the pool you could only stand as it was so full. People were so drunk from the large cocktails being sold it was quite rediculous. Beds were large and comfortable - room was OK (nothing special) food sold in the hotel again OK but nothing special. I would not stay in this hotel again..	2	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

As several others have stated, there was a long line at check-in around 12:30 which took about 40 minutes. DH heard one of the employees say that Fridays and Sundays are the busiest for checking in. A sign in the lobby stated 3:00 is the usual check-in time, but that day check-in was available at 11:00. (Don't know if that's a permanent sign or if it changes.) Our junior suite on the 24th floor had a comfy king bed, pull-out couch and two bathrooms (one with jetted tub, one with a shower), plus a small fridge in one of the closets. The view out our window was of the TI pool, plus the Strip looking south. I'd recommend sleeping with earplugs, since there was quite a bit of hallway noise from other guests.<br/><br/>Housekeeping during our stay was great. Room was clean and the maid was friendly and courteous when we happened to see her. <br/><br/>We ate several times at Kahunaville, mostly because it was reasonably priced and there often wasn't a long line during our stay. We had their $8 breakfast (eggs, potatoes, meat and toast). DH wasn't thrilled with his eggs one morning but overall the meals were fine. We also used a 2-for-1 dinner coupon. Using the coupon limits you to one page of the menu, but we were OK with that and the food was good. Our server Roland was helpful and friendly, in an unobtrusive way. We also had a quick lunch at Canter's Deli; sandwiches were tasty, but not cheap. <br/><br/>Since it was over 100 degrees several days during our stay and I wanted to sit in the shade, we didn't end up using the pool because there was very little shade available. (The lounge chairs that WERE in the shade were reserved for people who want to pay extra for a cabana, which annoyed me--I don't know what the cost was, I was just irritated by the nickel-and-diming aspect.) <br/><br/>Saw the Sirens show our first evening. I liked the old pirate show of years ago better; this one seems pretty hokey, but hey, it's free. <br/><br/>The $25 resort fee is combined with a $3 tip that doesn't appear to be optional, so we paid $28 per day for Internet use and other included &quot;amenities.&quot; Didn't bother to go collect the daily newspaper in the lobby, but we did use the boarding pass printer and a couple of the meal/drink coupons. <br/><br/>Although not an upscale hotel, we enjoyed our stay at TI and would probably stay again, if the price was right.	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

Check in took a while because of the line at the counter.<br/>The women that checked me in was pleasant and put us on the fourth floor of the 30+ floor hotel. The room overlooked the boilers and some tower, awful. Called down to the desk and told them the room was not to our liking. They told me to come down and they would see what they could do. Waited in line again. Same women waited on me and told me they could not move us because they were booked up (here we go) got a manager to help, same thing nothing. I said I would pay for an upgrade to anything better. We are here for our 18th anniversary and just want to enjoy ourselves. He found a Petite Suite on the 16th floor. Went up to the room better view, horrible room, bad odors, run down, kind of creepy.<br/>Called down again, same procedure, different manager. Asked for the best accommodations possible. Sorry no can do. Called our friends at the Palazzo and asked how their room was. They said it was top notch. The manager told me he could move us the next day on overhearing my conversation.

We checked in on a thurs at 9.00pm check in wasnt too bad, it was the weekend of electric daisy so most hotels were jam packed, we got a room on 19th floor overlooking fashion mall. Room was very clean, plenty of fresh towels and amenities were supplied, house keeping was great. Room was quiet even though it was an adjoining room. The beds were just as they were way back then comfy, cosy and a dream to sleep in, I never sleep well in vegas and I have to say I slept like a baby each nite.<br/>There is plenty here to do and a lot of cheap bars doing happy hour deals, the casino always seemed busy and not too smokey, i would stay here again as the price was great, the only thing that was a bit pricy was the resort fee, $28 per day is a lot but i knew this before hand and added it into cost when booking.	3	4	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

We chose TI based on strip location, price and pool. <br/><br/>Checked in around 7pm and there was no line up. The girl on the desk was overally friendly, but got us checked in without any hassel. I think that the Resort fee is a bit ridiculous, yes you get $100 worth of coupons/discounts but we were there for 4 nights and our resort fees came to over $112 so its not like we got any sort of a deal. I think they should really look at the number of nights that you are staying. <br/><br/>The Pool was great we went everyday and never had a problem finding chairs. We even moved a few times to get a shady spot. The music was great and was a good mix. <br/><br/>Our Room was ok nothing special is terms of size/ decore, we stayed at Planet Hollywood on the last trip and got spoilt by their large rooms. Although we both thought the beds were super comfy and the pillows were great. Housekeeping came every day, made beds and refreshed towels. <br/><br/>Had a good time playing the slots in the casino. I personally didnt notice it to be overally smokey as mentioned in some other reviews. <br/><br/>Thought it was a great stay all around, but will probably chose a different hotel next year just to try something different.	4	5	-1	3	3	3	-1	5

The first room they gave us was awful. There was dust everywhere, used chewing gum stuck to the table, stains all over the carpet and duct tape on the window sill. When we requested a change of rooms, they seemed pretty put out and not at all pleased. We did move,however, and the next room was better. It was a small room, but cleaner.<br/>The hotel itself needs a makeover. It's dark (everything is brown), and it makes you feel like you're in a cave. The worst part is the smoke. Everyone that stays there, it seems, smokes. It's gross! That's all you smell. We visited a lot of hotels and this one is very bad for that. It also seems that the cliental is very young. If you are of a more mature age group, you might prefer a different hotel. A lot of young kids seem to go there to party. <br/>It is definitely not a bad hotel, however, we would not stay there again.	4	5	-1	3	4	3	-1	-1

The check in process was great, the front desk clerk was very friendly, the Valet parking was faster than a lot of the other Vegas hotels. A was going to complain about the resort fee which was over 25 dollars per night, but they gave me two complimentary buffet tickets. The buffet was excellent! The room was clean. The only thing I would ask them to change is 2 things. First, put a lock on the door knob in the bathroom. Somebody got walked on taking a you know what. Add HD to your flat screen T.V. I saw the free show Sirens, and the Cirque Sole show Mystrere, excellent show. I went to the fitness center, I had a great work out session. You will have a good time.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

The rooms were nice and a great value but the BIG disappointment was TI's swimming pool...my boyfriend and I could not believe how small the pool was considering there are 2800 rooms at TI. Really, it was the equivalent size of a bathtub!! there were hundreds of people packed into this small pool in 100 degree weather...it was disgusting and unsanitary. There was no way my boyfriend would go in and wouldn't even put his feet in to cool off because there was a thick top layer of suntan oil floating in the water not to mention bandaids and other gross things. They really need to overhaul their pool area to compete with the pools at Flamingo or Mirage. Won't go back .....unless it is during winter when swimming not such a necessity.	4	4	-1	4	3	3	-1	4

We traveled as a family (3 adults) and checked into the hotel with Taneaka (who was great!) and she placed us in great room on the 24th floor overlooking the full strip. We could see the volcano at the Mirage, the water fountains of the Bellagio, and lots more. We were in a room with 2 queens - which were VERY comfortable and the room was very clean. We ate at the buffet (which was good, but a bit pricey) on the 2 for 1 coupon, and we had 2 free coupons for a meal there also. Went to Kahunaville restaurant in the hotel for breakfast (good service, good food and lots of it and a great waitress). We also had the after wedding party there and they were very helpful. Did not care for the food at The Cafe, but it worked in a pinch. Felt safe since halls were well lit, halls and elevators were clean, and there was a security guard checking room keys to go up in elevators at night. Found all employees to be very helpful and respectful. I would mention that at checkin, make sure ALL people staying in room are listed on the register. Our son's key would not work and he had a very hard time getting a new key, but the front staff worked with him, asking security questions to make sure he was really with us. We were glad they did that, but got his name listed the next day! The pool looked nice, but we never had time to go there. Not happy about the resort fee since we didn't use most things that were included in the fee, but all hotels seem to be charging it now (just like the airplane extra fees). If looking for a good hotel, I would suggest this one. We would stay there again - use their online specials for the best prices.	5	4	-1	5	4	4	-1	5

We have stayed at several of the other more flamboyant and luxurious resorts, but somehow we keep coming back to TI. I think what I like about this resort is that it is small in comparison, to the other resorts on the strip. This makes it easier to negotiate around the hotel and going to and from other places on the strip. The rooms are nice and if you get a strip view room, you won't be disappointed. The cost is very reasonable, so when you lose all of your money in the casino, it hurts less. : )	4	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

Overall it was a good stay in a plain room. My one major complaint is that there was not a coffee maker in the standard room. Big disappointment and an expensive cost. My only other disappointment was the lighting in the bathroom. Please don't get me wrong... this was a decent room for the cost and the comps were nice (buffet, drinks, etc.). I didn't tour the other rooms. The sky bridge to the mall was great and the proximity to Walgreens is SUPER. Take advantage people. Purchasing items at Walgreens across the skywalk will save you money. The room was quiet, the pillows were great and our view was very nice=) Not super impressed with the &quot;Sirens&quot; show but that wasn't why we came and even tho I didn't care for the show the landscaping is fun. My poor review on the breakfast is more related to cost than anything else. Our waitress was very good. My review of average on location is simply reflective of what one wants to do in Vegas. For my travel plans this time around it was good.	4	3	-1	3	3	3	-1	4

I got a great price on a &quot;name your price&quot; type of deal...so for what I paid it was fine. The beds were average, the rooms were nicely decorated, easy casino to maneuver through. I do wish the regular Cafe restaurant was more noticeable in the front by check in...I thought it was all part of the Vietnamese restaurant that was next to it till the last day. If you get a strip view facing the Sirens ship show...be prepared for late night cannons going off. This normally wouldn't be a problem except for the days of the week I was there for business and actually tried to sleep before 11pm. I really liked the pool...lots of palm trees which were nice. I didn't like how they booked the cabanas...I called to reserve a cabana for a Saturday a week and half before arriving and was put on a wait list...#6! They constantly told me my chances were good, you have to wait in your room for a call that morning to see if you got one. I got tired of waiting and went down to the pool where they told me I didn't get one (9:30am). I understand they give high rollers and regular guests priority, but what really made me mad is that half of the cabanas stayed un-used ALL day long! I was ready to pay and use, but they obviously would rather keep them empty and lose money waiting for people that never showed up. That was the only negative. I get cabanas often at different hotels and never had an experience like this, in 110 heat, it would have been nice. Overall, the stay was nice, the location is a little to far north on the strip for me, I prefer to be closer to the middle (PH, Cosmopolitain, Aria). I loved having 2 Starbucks....one inside and one outside. I would stay again, but not my first choice unless I got a great deal again!!	3	2	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

Good location right on the strip and it has a good buffet breakfast. Wasn't very impressed with the Sirens Pirate show (I think the males in the audience enjoyed it more!).

The place was stuffy, smelt of stale tobacco, the food and drinks were expensive and on top of that they demanded a resort fee for items we did not want nor use.<br/>Other hotels advertise they do not charge a resort fee and we advise going for those. The extra daily fee is a rip off; why can't they just have a single room charge.<br/><br/>We will not return to TI as there is too much competition out there.	1	5	-1	3	2	3	-1	3

Treasure Island was not my first choice, but I've always wanted to check it out because the resort has been one of the icons resort in Vegas for a long time. We stayed for three nights, and our goal was to party, eat, and go sightseeing through the strip. I used to love to gamble, but I've cut back a lot because of the wife. I did do some gambling at Treasure Island. I really like the location of TI resort. It's located close enough in the center of the strip where you can walk either way and see all the popular casinos. It's right next door to the Fashoin Show Mall, and adjacent to the Wynn and Encore resort. We went to the night club Surrender at Encore and that was a blast once you get in after 45 minutes of waiting. I walked to the Bellagio and it only took me 10 mins. If you are looking for a late night bite and not looking to eat at the Coffee shop, it's only a five minute drive on Spring Mountain Rd to get some good pho at Pho Kim Long which is open 24hrs. I also saw a Thai restaurant that was open 24hrs too on the same street. The restaurants at TI seemed really expensive to me where if your looking for a bowl of pho it'll cost you $12, or some asian platter will cost you about $20. There are no deals for food unless the casino is comping your meals. I suggest renting a car and drive off the strip for your local eateries. Plenty of places to eat in Vegas. The room we had was pretty nice facing the strip. The bed was the highlight of the hotel. The bed was so comfortable we slept great all three nights from 5am to 9am. The casino looked old and dumpy. The odds of winning at TI is as good as any other place. They have all the table games with a decent limit. The poker room though is a joke. You'll be lucky to find a game because there's no one there playing. I like TI, but I'd probably would not stay here again. There are too many resorts and casinos to choose from. I don't mind spending a little more money to stay in a nicer place like the Wynn, Encore, or Bellagio, but for the price we paid for TI it was a steal. Also the wedding was being head there so we didn't have much of a choice. I like the location and the room was nice, but overall the resort looked run down and old.	4	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	5

One good thing is the location is awesome. Right next to the big mall, and a short walk to the Venetian, Caesars Palace, Wynn, etc. Love the location and that is why I picked it besides a killer price as I am a &quot;TI Insider&quot;. The room was actually very dirty, I let TI know this too on a follow up survey. It was like the room had not been cleaned in days with dust build up so bad on the nightstand, phone, lamp and alarm clock when I swiped my finger across them you could tell by my path of removing the dust. Not cool since I already had horrible allergies due to the amount of smoke in the casino. The bed was really comfy at least and our stay was quiet. The hotel was at full capacity, but I never heard any noise while in the room, so that was a plus too. Compared to the Wynn, Encore and Aria, its not a 5 and the non-cleanliness of the room took it to a 3. I don't think I will be back to TI after this go-around.	3	5	-1	-1	2	5	-1	5

The line up to check in was long and ridiculous though. We waited for at least an hour and had to change our dinner reservations. And waiting for our vehicle took forever as well. <br/><br/>But the room was right off the elevator so we didn't have to walk far and the elevator was right by the casino floor. It wasn't a maze and easy to get around. Plus you are right on the strip as opposed to having to walk from somewhere. <br/><br/>The ranch/saloon was cool and the Treasure Island show is free nightly (it's hilarious, you'll have to watch it, just to say you saw it).	4	3	-1	3	5	4	-1	5

Stay here if you want a clean and functional room with very basic service. Front desk staff is on par with ultra lower end properties in terms of politeness,wich means their only goal is take your ID, your credit card and get you the hell out of there asap with no smile or whatevere. If this hotel would at least plan a casino remodel It could really make a difference. And smoke,this place is filled with smoke not even the old Binion in downtown used to be. I guess air filters cost big money to replace/service. Food : very surprised by Francesco's pizzeria,really the best pizza ever but everything else is pretty mediocre.

I'm not a fan of Vegas and don't really gamble and got bored at the tables after a very short time. One of the parents in our group had a great time at the tables and it was so nice to have them right there (of course, that's true all over town). The location of TI was good but the shuttle from the airport took a mysteriously circuitous route and we thought we'd never get there.

Very spectacular. <br/><br/>Housekeeping quite poor, stained sheets when I arrived and not perfectly clean room (not too bad I suppose). <br/><br/>The pool had a poor drinks service unless your face fit!! Bottle strewn around the pool and people drinking in the pool. It might be Vegas but some people just like to chill at the pool. On the plus side it was always fairly easy to get a sun lounger. <br/><br/>The choice of restaurants and food was pretty poor.<br/><br/>It was an easy hotel/casino to navigate around as it's not too big which is great for weary Vegas feet. I loved the tram to the Mirage and the shops were good with friendly staff. <br/><br/>I was charged for a movie I didn't watch and the girl checking me out wouldn't believe I hadn't watched it. <br/><br/>I resented paying the resort fee as many of the 'perks' were only suitable for 2 people e.g. 2 for 1 buffet. As a solo traveller I couldn't get anything from the resort fee except wifi which I didn't need. I wouldn't resent paying this fee if they changed the perks for solo travellers e.g. half price buffet. <br/><br/>Pretty underwhelmed by the hotel in general but the view from my room was amazing.	3	4	-1	3	2	3	-1	3

I have seen house swimming pools larger than that. Forget about swimming or even walking in the pool. You keep bumping into other people. Also, no early check in or late check out. They tell you upon availability; but even though hotel had lots of vacancies, told me not available. Many tricks you must watch for. My stay was a disaster. No good people, no good hotel.	1	3	-1	1	2	1	-1	1

As a result I asked the reception clerk to speak up because I was very deaf. This he did not (or would not) do in spite of being asked several times. Again, because I was not feeling well I asked for a quiet room.<br/><br/>When we got to the room we could hear very loud rock music coming from the pool area below. I called the front desk and was told that this would finish at 5-00pm. I was prepared to accept this and tried to get some sleep while waiting for the noise to stop (impossible). We then realised the basin in the bathroom was blocked so had to call the front desk to get this fixed.<br/>My wife then noticed that there was no spare toilet paper in the bathroom - another call to the front desk.<br/><br/>At 5-10pm the music had not stopped so I called again only to be told that it did not finish until 8-00pm! I asked what time it started and was told 8-00am! I then asked to be moved to another room.<br/><br/>When we got to the new room we found there was no bath/shower mat (another call to the front desk). We later noticed that there was no soap or shampoo in the bathroom (yet another call).<br/><br/>We paid a lot of money to stay here and I think we had a right to expect far better service than we received.	2	5	-1	4	5	1	-1	4

Traveled with my wife and our 3 year old near the end of May 2012. The hotel was average. We had stayed at Aladdin Hotel (before it became Planet Hollywood) and thought that was bigger and better. TI casino area was very smokey and it is very noticeable compared to other hotels. Bed sheets had rips and stains but fortunately we did not encounter any bed bugs. Rooms were smaller than Aladdin and would think they are smaller than other hotels on the strip as well. We requested 2 queen beds. Check in line was long, the wait was 40min. I did the $20 tip trick and it worked quite well I think. We didn't necessarily get an upgrade to a suite but we got a strip view and 2 free buffet coupons which were worth more than $20 bux. Location was good but we found ourselves taking the Deuce to Paris/PH area more often because we preferred that area better. The buffet at TI was better than some of the buffets on the BUFFET OF BUFFETS list. Also Pho Restaurant was delicious. Would go back there even if we didn't stay there next time. We probably won't stay here again though, not because it was bad but because we would look to try other hotels, especially ones that are not as smokey.	3	3	-1	4	3	3	-1	4

We chose to stay at T.I. because of my mother who couldn't afford to stay at the Wynn where we were meeting family that weekend. It is in a fabulous location. Near the Wynn and Encore on one side of the street and the Palazzo and Venetian on the other and right next door to the Mirage. Depending on where your room is you either get a great view of the strip, a great view of the Wynn or a great view of the mountains. The non-smoking rooms are non-smoking! Thank goodness cause as soon as you hit the elevators to go down its smokey! The signage was very confusing and a lot of people everywhere but overall it wasnt terribly bad. Room was clean, bathroom was clean and check-in was fast and easy; however, we did our's at about 10PM on a Friday night. Saturday morning was rough for all the people standing in line waiting to checkin, long lines. The Coffee Shop resturant had friendly people and we mainly ate here for Breakfast because I do not eat a buffets but the food seemed &quot;premade&quot; and the prices were outrageous for what you get. Even the wait here was long at times when there were empty tables sitting around. Will not stay here again but only because we can afford more than this and we did it as a favor to my mom.	3	4	-1	3	4	3	-1	5

The reason I picked this hotel was the special rate they had -- $60/night plus 2 free buffet tickets. We stayed 2 nights in a king room. The room was spacious. It was clean when we checked in and well maintained. The bathroom is good sized. Our room also had a good size mini-frig. <br/>I could hear our neighbor's TV. What I didn't like was the parking/unloading situation. Since we drove we had our car. Parking in the self-parking garage, it is a VERY LONG trek from the garage to the hotel elevators past the hotel's shops where they try to get you to buy and through the casino just to get to your room. You can't unload your car where you check in which is a little closer to the elevator unless you either use the valet (which I no longer use after a bad valet experience somewhere else where they damaged my car) or pay for bell hop service.	5	3	-1	5	5	3	-1	-1

Chose Treasure Island, I refuse to call it TI,<br/>mostly because I have stayed here before and It is centrally located. <br/>Mostly the same,altho Gilleys and Senor Frogs are a new addition. <br/>Arrived about 10am and was pleasantly surprised that they were offering a 10AM checkin,<br/>instead of the usual 3PM. Ana got me a 31st floor room, strip view, looking at the plazzo<br/>and directly over the &quot;pirate show&quot;. <br/>Room was OK, very comfortable bed, no frills, nice bathroom, housekeeping will not change your sheets unless you request it. <br/>As for the restaurants,... thats were the hotel loses points. <br/>Do not eat at The Buffet, just my opinion, but not a good deal; too expensive and not really a good selection of food. The Coffee Shop wasnt that much better, they were always busy and always seemed understaffed. <br/>Went to go see KA, Cirque DE Soleil, this is a MUST SEE, splurge for the good seats if you can afford it well worth the money. <br/>Next vegas trip will try another hotel. .	3	4	-1	4	4	3	-1	4

I will not step foot back into that casino and I won't consider staying at the resort ever again. I was expecting more and Treasure Island certainly did not deliver. Thought I would give them a chance, but downtown Vegas continues to be the place where they treat you like a long-lost cousin. They appreciate the business and it's reflected in generous comps...Treasure Island does not believe in comps, unless you are a high-high roller.	1	2	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

Will definitely stay there again. I dnt udnerstand why one needs to pay for WiFi in big hotels because thta should be for free for guests booking rooms. During our 16 day trip, we stayed at many hotels but have to admit that the toiletries from the Oleksandra Spa was the best part of the trip's toiletries. Even better than Caeser's Palace. For $25/ day resort fees, not bad. My sister used the gym everyday and got bottles of mineral water and fruit. We got 50% on 1 buffet (for our entire stay) - good spread even though one cant really compare it to the Bellagio buffet. But for people who can eat and still want to spend less money, try this spread. Loved their Italian and dessert section of the spread.	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

I should start my review by saying that I was also in Vegas in April and I stayed at the Venetian that time. *sigh* That was a hard act to follow and Treasure Island was not up to the task. My impressions:<br/><br/>1. From the very beginning, the staff was very friendly and professional.<br/>2. Check-in was quick and easy and we did not have to wait until 3pm.<br/>3. The hotel stinks. It's not just cigarette smoke, it might be the cleaners they use or something. After a couple of days we got used to it but it was very noticeable at first.<br/>4. We had a deluxe strip view room. The view was great in fact because we had the strip to our left and the mountains to the right. Also our room overlooked the pool.<br/>5. Having said that, the window was disappointingly small and dirty. Also there is a lot of noise from the pool. Thank goodness it closed at 8pm or we would have needed another room.<br/>6. Speaking of noise, we could hear a lot of noise from the strip. I've never had that problem before and I've stayed in Vegas several times before.<br/>7. The buffet was not that great.<br/>8. The rooms are small and dark. Also we did not have a clock in our room or a luggage stand. Odd. <br/>9. Overall, TI does not compare favorably to the Venetian except in one respect: it's smaller and the casino was not nearly as big or busy. This was a definite plus.<br/><br/>Would I recommend it? It was affordable(the reason I chose it), clean and in a great location. If budget is an issue, I would say yes. If you can afford it, give yourself a treat and stay at Venetian, Wynn, Bellagio or even the Flamingo.	3	5	-1	3	3	4	-1	3

Nothing much, which i think is part of the issue. The rooms have apparently been updated in the last 5 years but i'll be honest, i couldnt tell. This hotel is looking very tired and also the staff seem to be the same. <br/>Our biggest issue was when we checked in. We arrived at reception with a pre-paid voucher with confirmation and reciept number etc for the petite-suite we booked. When checking in there appeared to be no issues however when we arrived at the door to our room, i knew we'd been given the wrong room as the petite suite has double exterior doors, and this was a single. <br/>I called down to the front desk to explain and was told by a very rude member of staff that this WAS our room, to which i told him in no uncertain terms it wasnt, so after a few seconds of silence he said i needed to come back down to sort this out, rather than they come to me as it had already inconvenienced us after a long 10hour+ flight from the uk. <br/>Anyway i kept my calm and we tracked back down the elevator, through the casino and back to the front desk to only be comfornted by some fairly big lines now. Eventually we got to the front of the line and explained, to what i can only describe as a statue for a member of staff, no expression, no smile, no voice and certainly no pleasantries. <br/>Eventually this lady spoke to us and advised us that there had been some 'mix up' with the booking, but despite being able to prove anything my wife and i are almost certain that TI amended our booking and simply tried to fob us off with a standard room when we've booked and paid for a more superior room.<br/>We were eventually given the room we had booked by being advised that TI would honour our booking (as if we should be grateful) but recieved no apology, or were not offered anything by the way of apology due to the inconvenience this caused, which cost us well over an hour of out vacation time. <br/>Overall i found the service to be poor at best right through the property, along with the fact that it really wasnt a very clean hotel. Just move anything static in your room to uncover an amazing amount of dust and dirt, its pretty disgusting to be honest. Also the pool was so unclean, i chose not to go in it, despite it being over 100 degrees. There were alsorts of things floating in there!<br/>So unfortunately when we return to Vegas again i will not be considering staying at TI, whilst its one of the cheapest on the strip, you can actually understand why. Spend a little more as the other hotels (Venetian, Wynn, Mirage) at this end of the strip are leaps ahead,	2	3	-1	2	1	1	-1	3

The room and hotel were clean. The location was reasonable. However, the atmosphere at the hotel and casino seemed that they were doing us a favor by allowing us to spend about $140/per night for a room that did not even have a coffeemaker or mini fridge. This sounds petty until you realize that a cup of coffee is $3 and a beer is $7. I know that the desert did not get green by giving things away, but really? We were happy to spend $39 each for the Bellagio buffet (more than worth it), but felt more nickle and dimed to death than when we went on our last cruise. Also disappointing was the myth of drinks pouring freely when you gamble. Not so much at TI, however, Casino Royale was fabulous! Will return to Vegas at some point, but will definitely go to a different hotel.	2	4	-1	3	4	1	-1	3

Our room was in great condition and the bed was extremely comfortable. <br/>We previously stayed at the Venetian for the last 2 years. Although that is more elegant, one of the main disappointments was that there weren't any drawers to unpack our things. At TI we had 3 sets of drawers and a small refrigerator! The fridge is not standard in the regular rooms of the Venetian. The Venetian also did not give seconds on the toiletries, but TI did.<br/>When we are in Vegas we do not hang out in the room. The place needs to be clean, the bed comfortable and when the price is lower, all the better! All of our needs were meet at TI.<br/>They also helped me with a bad handle on my suitcase which was over and above what I expected. Thank you Vickie.<br/>We will stay at TI again.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Our room was very nice, clean and comfortable. We went with another couple and were able to get ajoining rooms making it like a small suite. Of course, when in Vegas you rarely spend much time in the room.<br/><br/>The hotel staff were always helpful and friendly and the cleaning staff did a great job on our room every day. The location of TI is close to the Fashion Show Mall, the Mirage Volcanoes (both next door) and just down from the water show at the Bellagio. If you want to go further toward the Luxor/Excaliber/MGM area we suggest getting the $7/day bus passes to get you quickly from one end of the strip to the other as well as downtown to Freemont Street. We used the bus a lot because it saved us a lot of time and was nice when the days were over 100 degrees each day.<br/><br/>Overall we enjoyed our stay. The atmosphere was fun as we spent plenty of time partying it up in their casino as well as their clubs &quot;Kahunaville&quot; and &quot;Senior Frogs&quot;. The breakfast buffet at TI was one of our favorite meals during our stay too. (Just be sure to use your 2 for 1 buffet coupon that comes with your room key as it is a little pricey.) Lastly, the &quot;Sirens of TI&quot; Pirate show out front of the hotel is a bit cheesy but still a must see at least once.<br/><br/>We would definitely recommend Treasure Island to friends.	4	4	-1	4	4	5	-1	5

We queued for an hour which was rather irritating when you just want to get on with your day. They did at least bring round free bottles of water!<br/>The room was very well appointed with a lovely bathroom, comfy beds and plenty of storage. One thing I would have dearly loved was tea making facilities - we waited til we went downstairs and bought tea from Starbucks but would have been so much nicer if I could have made one myself in my room. As far as I could tell, you didn't seem to get free drinks whilst gambling - maybe you do when at the tables but I didn't see any being given out at the machines. When you go to the swimming pool you get the pleasure of having your bag searched by the humourless man on the door. There is a large Walgreens across the road so I guess people are buying stuff from there and trying to smuggle it in to save money - though I wouldn't have bothered. I understand they will not want this but they could be a bit more friendly when they do the searching! If you buy a soft drink at the pool bar you do get free refills all day so the cost works out ok as long as you have more than one drink. The Bellagio buffet is really good - we were actually given 2 free buffets as part of our booking and the choice was great. You do have to queue for at least half an hour at peak times but the food is very nice. Got my room at a very reasonable price, especially with the buffets, and really shouldn't complain but it did all feel rather impersonal - large queues and grumpy staff - with the exception of the guys on the pool bar who were really friendly.

I was plucking up the courage to ask for a Strip View when she upgraded us as she had no King Beds available - woo hoo! <br/><br/>I liked the size of TI its not too big so you gets lost and within a few hours we had our bearings.<br/><br/>We had room 34026 and i was amazed by the View it was fantastic, looked out over Venetian, Mirage Volcano you could even see the bellagio fountains go off! Great Start.<br/><br/>Room was large and spacious, 2 queen beds, table dresser and chairs. Toilet was a good size with a deep bath tub. Safe was included in room, we couldnt get the code to work so called down to frot desk within 5 mins someone had appeared to fix it, great service.Maid service was everyday on time, if we put the do not disturb sign up she always double checked if we wanted it cleaned.<br/><br/>Hotel Casino was a little smokey but nothing too bad, the bars/restuarants in TI were great. We spent a lot of time at Kahunaville, what a party atmosphere and a lot of fun. Senor Frogs is a good laugh too. We had free passes to the Buffet though sadly never got round to using them, i did hear a lot of good reviews though! <br/><br/>Location for us was perfect, we stayed at Luxor last trip and felt we never got to explore this side of the Strip so TI was ideal for that, in no time you were at Caesars, Wynn etc perfect! <br/><br/>The Pool was Small compared to other Hotels, but we always managed to get a lounger even going down at 2pm! At the w-ends it is a Party Pool and can get pretty busy, but we loved the atmosphere and the DJ! During the week there was no DJ set so it got a little quiter although they did still play music. <br/><br/>Overall, Great Location, Large comfy rooms, Great views of the Strip &amp; friendly staff	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

The room was clean and comfortable (best hotel bed I've ever slept in!), the staff was friendly, and I got an excellent deal by booking early through the TI website. The AC worked great, there was a nice fridge in the room and the locking safe was large enough for my big dSLR camera, iPad and other electronics. I liked that TI is a smaller hotel--much easier to navigate. Yes, there are less restaurants due to it's size but it's easy to go next door to another hotel or even the shopping mall food court nearby. If you are going to a show at the Venetian or Mirage it's a pefect place to stay plus you can easily walk the strip from TI's location. I will definately return. Thanks TI, you made my first stay in Vegas a great one!.	5	5	-1	4	4	5	-1	5

My check in lady was super sweet and friendly. My room was nice and clean, comfortable bed. The hotel area was clean over all except for the cigarette smoke in the casino area but most casinos have smokey lobbies. The Buffet was pretty cool. They have an awesome omelette bar made fresh to order. The best part for me was the Pool. Great pool party, live music and a cool crowd of people. The money you pay for this hotel is well worth it.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Treasure Island is falling apart need a change quickly. Great location and pool but housekeeping and management need to be fired. Housekeeping lied to manager. They also lost 1 out of our 5 bags that were all on the cart. Either my computer fell off the cart or they took it off hoping I would forget or something. I had to literally go down to retrieve it myself they were shady. Such a nightmare our stay there was cleaning up after them. We are treated like the bad guys, disrespected in the lobby by manager, threaten to get security, and it was all because they dont know how to resolve problems and make there customers happy. Do not stay here for your own well being. Platinum Hotel is up the street/ half the price/ twice the size/ much nicer management.	2	5	-1	2	1	1	-1	2

I had a great experience then and Treasure Island was perfect for our stay once again! Our room was spotlessly clean and had been updated since my last stay. We had a flat screen TV, two queen beds, and ample room for 3 ladies. The pool area is great, although crowded. But, all three days of our stay the temps were over 100 degrees every day so that's not a surprise. The hotel connects to the Mirage via a tram (helpful when the feet get tired of walking). There is also a walkway that connects to the Fashion Show Mall across the street. The location is super convenient, not exactly center of the strip but easily accessible to anything and everything by way of cab, monorail, walking or the tram. I didn't gamble much on this trip but I did go to Gilley's nightclub with my friends one night during our stay and we had a great time. Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely stay here again.	5	4	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

We felt fortunate to be able to get a room on the Las Vegas strip. We were headed to a vacation at Grand Canyon. But when we got to the hotel, they didn't have a bedroom with 2 queens as we had requested and they had promised online. So we were stuck with 3 children and a king size bed with a pull-out couch. The room itself was fairly small and one of our children slept on the floor on couch cushions while the other two slept in the pull-out couch. It was not ideal but since it was late, we were glad for a place to lie down. We did have 2 large bathrooms that were each almost as large as the sleeping area which made it easy to get ready in the morning.	3	5	-1	4	5	4	-1	2

The staff isnt super chatty but they are helpful when you need anything, the pool was small but had free towels and a bar, and was never very crowded. The hotel has great dining and bars but no club, however seeing as its right next to Ceasers Palace, The Venetian, and a few other swanky hotels with great clubs it was never an issue. Its located in the center of the strip and theres really no need to leave that area!	5	5	-1	5	5	3	-1	5

Arrived at the hotel at 3:30. There were 80 people in line ahead of us to check in and the line went all the way to the revolving doors at the entrance. They had a total of 3 clerks checking in guests (one of which just kept complaining about getting off in 15 minutes so she would not have to put up with &quot;us&quot; ( the guests), any longer. Once this disaster was over and done with, the rest of the stay was good. The rooms were good, very clean and comfortable. If I were to go to this hotel again, I would make sure that I arrived early in the morning to avoid the long lines. PS, The buffet was excellent!!!	3	4	-1	4	4	1	-1	4

The hotel generally was good but to wait in line for almost 2 hours in order to check into the room is by all means unacceptable. We also noticed that the hotel was packed with youngsters who were wandering around drunk! The room however was quite big and clean. The important privilege of the hotel is that you can do check-out without passing from the reception, by leaving the keys - cards in the room, of course, if you have arranged in advance the payment of the room. The location is good and the buffet is quiet sufficient and one of the cheapest in town, when compared to the buffets of other big hotels in the Strip. In addition, the show that the hotel offers is very impressive and free to watch.	3	4	-1	4	4	2	-1	4

The room is very updated, flatscreen TV, plenty of drawer space, nice linen on the bed, comfortable. Bathroom was big and updated as well. Only complaint: Housekeeping didn't completely replenish our ammenities after the 2nd day. Ate at Kahaunaville,and enjoyed the food. Also went dancing at Senor Frogs, very fun and enjoyable.

This was my 1st time in Vegas (I know, I know!) so I asked a friend I trust for a recommendation that was not too expensive, on the strip, and that she thought would be fun for us. So here is the good, the not-so-good, and the &quot;OK in small doses&quot; of Treasure Island.<br/><br/>Check In - VERY long line @ 3 pm on a Thursday, but it moved quickly. At check in, we asked for available upgrades and for extra $50 a night were given a strip view Junior Suite, on a high floor (Room 20002). Check in staff very friendly &amp; efficient. Very roomy suite, with sitting area and pull out sofa, king bed, and TWO bathrooms (woo hoo!). Both had their own closet, one had a safe, one had roomy shower &amp; the other had jacuzzi tub. So nice not to have to share, and also to be able to unpack &amp; spread out all my girly stuff :-) I do not travel light! This would make this room ideal also for a family traveling together. There was also a small fridge in one of the closets for drinks &amp; snacks. The strip view was from a window in the corner, that also looked down over the pool area - this is not wall-to-wall windows, but yes, there is a view.<br/><br/>In-Room Amenities - NO mini bar - very odd....also no in-room coffee maker (Starbucks in the lobby, however). Very nice shampoo, etc. from the in-hotel spa and was replenished daily by maid service. WARNING - this king bed was one of the WORST we have ever slept on. It was like a reverse I Love Lucy bed - two deep trenches on either side of a large speed bump in the middle. We dealt with it for 2 nights then went to the front desk. They offered to move us (but why should we do all the work on this, I thought) and then graciously swapped out the entire bed while we were out. MUCH better bed this time &amp; the swift &amp; pleasant action by the front desk staff was much appreciated!<br/><br/>Restaurants - I would give these average marks for the three that we tried - Kahunaville (late afternoon arrival snacks), Buffet (dinner) and the Coffee Shop (for breakfast). Service in all was very quick and friendly, and the bar in Kahunaville puts on a show (a la &quot;Cocktail&quot; movie). All are very pricey considering that this is not top of the line food. We bought the buffet in conjunction with Cirque Mystere tickets, mostly for convenience. If you are looking for show-stopping Vegas buffet, this is not the place. Food was decent, not anything special. The female bartender in Kahunaville poured a monster margarita on Saturday with a Cuervo Gold &quot;floater&quot; on the rocks that lasted for FIVE HOURS . I kept pouring into smaller glasses &amp; taking it with me everywhere I went (like an evil pet....). I actually don't think I ever managed to finish it!<br/><br/>Show - Mystere was pretty good. I have seen a few other Cirque du Soleil shows in L.A. &amp; this one had a great variety of acrobatics, which I enjoy much more than the &quot;woo woo&quot; story lines they sometimes try to add in. Good for the whole family. Hubby had never seen Cirque, and he is pretty set in his ways, but he also enjoyed it &amp; found it entertaining. NOTE: Most seats are fine for this show since the theater is on the smaller side. Warning to those who sit close to the stage - you may become the victims of the comedian and he is a fan of spilling large vats of popcorn.<br/><br/>Poolside - OK, here's where it gets interesting. Friday was pretty nice &amp; quite hot. We decided to rent a poolside cabana (Cabana #8 - right in the middle) for the day (we had a $50 discount on this) as Hubby is not a real fan of the sun, while I am a worshipper :-) This was best of both worlds, with dedicated food &amp; drink waitress, cabana girl, lots of towels, upgraded chaises, flat screen TV (which would be mandatory for the Hubby during football season....), water &amp; soda included in the fridge, fruit plate (that we forgot to get!), shade or sun, and generally a birds eye view of the pool action. If you are there with a few friends or large family, I would recommend checking into &amp; sharing the cost of this option, particularly on the weekends, as on Saturday this pool was STANDING ROOM ONLY. Truly. It was like Daytona Beach Spring Break without the beach. A definitely younger 20 something crowd who were seriously drinking &amp; having a great time. DJ was poolside from 12 noon to at least 6 pm. I liked the music but if you are an older person who does not like rock, hip hop, and the like - this would probably NOT be your scene.<br/><br/>PARENTAL WARNING - This was not the place for small children or even younger teens. There was what can only be described as some VERY adult entertainer dancing going on right at poolside and in general, everyone is pretty ripped. Makes for good people watching but there is really no room for kids to even be in the pool. On Saturday it was quite literally standing room only in the pool - and also, not many of those folks looked like they were getting out to use the facilities, if you catch my drift. It may be much different during the week but you have been duly warned. The pool is closed at night &amp; I am sure they chlorine-shock the crap out of it.<br/><br/>Casino - quite large with a huge variety of slots and tables. On the weekend lowest blackjack was $15 for multi-deck, $10 for single deck. They had poker room and also high roller room and high value slot room. I am not much of a gambler (low money slots only) as I would rather SPEND my money than LOSE my money. Hubby plays blackjack &amp; found the dealers to be friendly, helpful, and he had some good luck. We would probably visit the casino again. Crowd was what I would describe as firmly middle class. It is a smoking casino but I have to say their ventilation &amp; air cleaning system was GREAT. I rarely if ever smelled the smoke or felt the yuckiness of others' smoking, and I am pretty sensitive to that.<br/><br/>Location - towards one end of the strip, across from the Wynn/Encore and also the Fashion Show mall (HUGE!!! and worth a visit). Close also to Venetian &amp; Palazzo hotels/shops/restaurants (we walked to those). Cab ride to other hotels, or walking distance if you A) have comfy shoes and/or B) it is not 100 degrees out (which it was....).<br/><br/>All in all - we had a really good time, due in no small part to the short duration of the visit as well as the length of time it had been since our last vacation. Next time we will probably go a bit more upscale just to try something different, and also I would prefer a pool with not quite so much &quot;action&quot;. I recommend for: fun couples, singles, families with older kids	4	4	-1	4	4	5	-1	2

For the $ TI was overall a good choice. I booked a package thru Expedia.ca. The room was very nice. It was clean and nicely spacious. Yes there are a few areas where the age was beginning to show but certainly not to the level I would deem unacceptable. Upon arrival there was a sign indicating that normal check in was noon but they were accepting checkins early (10am). I was pleased. Yes there was a line up (30 mins max) but certainly not a deal breaker. It moved quite well and with drink in hand...who cares? Check in was fast and the clerk was courteous. <br/>Now about the &quot;resort fee&quot;. The clerk did specifically ask me if I was aware of the fee before I BOOKED the room. I told her yes I was. A few of the items I used (mainly Wi-Fi) and some I didn't. All the people who whine and complain about the resort fee, here it is for you plain and simple...stay somewhere else! If you're on TripAdvisor then you obviously have enough insight to research the property you are staying at. See a &quot;resort fee&quot; or any other fee for that matter decide if it is something you are willing to pay and if there is value to you. If not...move on. Ok, back off the soap box. <br/>We did try the buffet (breakfast) and &quot;The Coffee Shop&quot;. Both as expected hotel restaurant fare. Nothing exceptional but good quality food for a &quot;Vegas&quot; price. All servers were courteous and friendly without being intrusive. <br/>Never made it into the pool but did stroll thru. Once again clean and well kept. <br/>As a Casino employee in Canada I still cannot get accustom to the sight of children within the casino. I would say there was a higher number of children staying here then say some of the other big strip hotels just based on touring around and making casual observations. <br/>Sleep was good. Beds very comfy. I usually have difficulty with the in-room A/C being noisy and waking me up when it is running. Not the case here, didn't even notice it. And yup it was on (over 100F every day). <br/>Will I stay here again? Likely not, as I like trying new places even if its in the same city. Will I recommend TI to friends and family?...yes I will. I think the value is good given &quot;Strip&quot; location and amenities. <br/>Remember... you're supposed to be on vacation...Relax and Lighten-Up.	4	5	-1	4	4	3	-1	4

Well situated, the hotel is a solid value. The room (a single non-smoking king) was large and well appointed. The bathroom was also spacious and complete. The air conditioning, lighting TV, etc. were all working properly. All was clean and neat. The pool area wasn't up to Mandalay Bay or Hard Rock standards, but was just fine. The TI staff was friendly and efficient. TI is home of Mystere which continues to sell out. I tried the Coffee Shop which was good, and the buffet (free with my room) which was adequate. The &quot;resort fee&quot; at $25/night plus tax is a rip off but it's hard to find a hotel on the strip that doesn't require it. At least the resort fee at the Hard Rock includes parking; not so at TI. All in all, TI is a solid value and I recommend it.	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

This location is across from Fashion Show Mall, Wynn, Encore. Right beside Mirage. We enjoyed the location as we dont partake in party activities. As it is on the North Side of the strip we enjoyed walking down the strip and returning back to home base. We have stayed in Las Vegas many times in the past and would return to this end of the strip. Would we return to this exact Hotel? Probably not.

Location:<br/><br/>Right opposite the Palazzo, next to Fashion Show Mall and the Mirage in one of the good places on the Strip. Virtually everything within easy walking distance if temperatures allow....<br/><br/>For people wanting to take pictures of Las Vegas Blvd. from their room, this is the ideal hotel. Book a stripview room and upon checkin ask for a south view room higher than 20th floor. North view is not that breathtaking. <br/><br/>In the lower floors the sirens of the TI or the Mirage Volcano can be disturbingly noisy. In our room (corner room of 36th floor) we had the fireworks exploding right in front of our window with every Sirens show. Neat.... <br/><br/>2. Hotel Layout:<br/><br/>A 36 storey Highrise. Not the highest one but high enough to allow excellent views.<br/><br/>3. Checkin:<br/><br/>We landed on the invited guests line. Quick but not overwhelmingly friendly. We almost ran into an argument with her over the &quot;non-matching&quot; reservation of &quot;Strip View&quot; and &quot;Smoking&quot;. The friendly concierge came and solved the issue to our advantage (Top Floor, Corner, Smoking).<br/><br/>4. Room:<br/><br/>Average size. 2007-8 makeover is already 4-5 years back. For Vegas very long. In our (Executive Floor) Room parts of the curtain were hanging down and the carpet had stains. The bath was not 100% clean (a black hair on the faucet - we are both blond). <br/><br/>Bed is still excellent. LCD TV is small and without Full HD. <br/><br/>A/C had difficulties (no floor above us) to keep the room cool. It was 110 degrees outside....<br/><br/>Bath is nothing special but spacious and well equipped. Since our last stay in 09 they changed the excellent Spa Amenities to the TI owner`s wife`s (a russian supermodel) not so good own line. <br/><br/>Carpets on the long Hallways could use replacement. Here and there a bucket of paint would also help.<br/><br/>5. Casino:<br/><br/>Seems to be smaller than it actually is. Sportsbook area not very comfortable. Slots: Well hidden 25 C slots. Tables: Empty during our stay. Poker area: very small. During the week not too many players. Intimate atmosphere. Love that during gambling.<br/><br/>6. Restaurants:<br/><br/>Did only try the Buffet and Kahunaville. Buffet for Breakfast too expensive, few choices, quality poor. Avoid! Kahunaville offers a better and less costly variation by the pool. <br/><br/>7. Pool:<br/><br/>Tiny. Enough Chairs but not enough Pool. <br/>Clean, helpful staff and normal &quot;me and you&quot; people around. Can be much different in other Casinos :-)<br/><br/>But Pool definitely needs to be bigger. <br/><br/>8. Staff:<br/><br/>Not really enthusiastic about their work. Could use extensive staff training and - maybe - a buck or two higher wages. Scratch it from the profit Mr. Ruffin! <br/><br/>9. Other:<br/><br/>Do avoid Valet at Checkout. We did when we checked in Sunday night and wanted our car Monday by 10:30 a.m. Biiig mistake. We waited for more than 45 minutes in the blazing sun. Reason: Very simple - not enough staff there. To TI human resources: Please hire two/three more people for Valet rush periods! <br/><br/>10. Conclusion:<br/><br/>We visited the Wynn/Encore and will most probably move there for our next stay in Vegas.	3	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	4

I booked early, got a great deal on the petite suite and was really looking forward to it. Check in took ages, but I was expecting that so can't complain. Was exhausted after coming from Brisbane Australia and wanted just to get to bed avoid jet lag and wake up fresh in the morning. Because of the exhaustion I slept for about four hours and woke with a sore back. The mattress was just to soft for me. The second night was worse, not an ounce of sleep. The next morning I inquired if there was any other types of mattress available, too my surprise, I was informed that all the petite suites had the same, I could have tried another if I wanted, but there was little point. The third night, I took the cover of the bed and went an curled up on the couch which was about the size of a king single, this was far more comfortable than the actual bed. Being in the casino I could hear every door at all hours of the nights, loud voices and drunk patrons, again, I sort of expected it, but reality hits hard. I did however get very used to the siren song every night until midnight. Overall, TI is quite nice, it's clean and friendly and I had no issues at all with the staff etc... just not upto my sleeping requirements.	5	4	-1	4	4	5	-1	1

The bell-service was great (our bellman went above and beyond the call of duty to help us with problems that we could not resolve on our own with the front desk). The service provided by the front desk was not acceptable. Our view is that the front desk is understaffed. As a result, the lines for check-in and for changing rooms were sprawling, and the helpfulness of the front desk in fixing errors of their own creation was limited, and unwilling, at best. <br/><br/>That said, the price is right for a pretty good hotel right in the middle of the Strip. Just understand that, in our experience, the front desk service was lacking.	4	5	-1	4	4	2	-1	4

We booked through priceline and got what I thought was a great deal. $60/night. Upon check-in we got a non-smoking room with 2 queen beds on the 31st floor. Also by some miracle we did not have to pay the resort fee? I'm not sure how, but we were really happy about it. Another point is that we arrived at 12:30 pm and they went ahead and allowed us to check into our room. I was honestly surprised at how nice the room was for what we paid. No smoke smell at all. Flat screen t.v., strip view. We couldn't have been happier. We were not in our room, but to basically sleep and shower. The only reason I have 4 stars instead of 5 is because you do have to pass through the very smokey casino to get to the hotel elevators and they are on the very north end of the strip. Luckily 1 show we had already booked was at the Mirage next door, but if you plan to casino hop I would choose a hotel more central to the strip.	4	3	-1	4	5	5	-1	5

Great location to step out on L.V. Blvd. and walk to other hotels and shops. Check in counter person was quite rude. She didn't really say anything other than &quot;next please&quot; &amp; &quot;bye&quot; (oh wait, she didn't say &quot;bye&quot;). That was a real turn off. I have had such wonderful experience with other L.V. Hotel check-ins, that really erked me. Otherwise, nice stay; clean room, pool view was good, bathroom clean. But I probably won't stay there again, other hotels offer a more positive staff and the stay just feels better and fun with people who want to be working at their job.	3	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

I only booked this hotel because it was Expedia VIP. When I got to the hotel there were only two lines labelled 'Casino Invited Guests' and everyone else. The lobby was a mess and overly crowded with no assistance offered in any way. So we got in line for check-in and it took over an hour. While we were waiting we noticed: Not all the check-in stations were manned, yet there was staff milling around. That's not exactly great service... After we get to the front they tell us: 'oh, as VIP you should have gone in the casino invited guests line.' Well, no one told us. <br/>We finally check in, and they gave us rooms with 2 Queen beds instead of the King beds that we requested. Already frustrated we bite the bullet and head up to the room. <br/>When we get to the room, the internet doesn't connect, the toilet won't flush (and overflows), and the 'couch' in the room is so dirty it's black. Not to mention the carpet is spotted grey and dirty. <br/>This hotel is by far less clean than even Luxor, and at significantly higher price point, I would NOT stay here ever again. Thank God we are only staying one night.	1	4	-1	1	1	1	-1	3

The room was nice and clean with a strip view. The hotel is also in a good location on the strip which is part of the reason we chose to stay here. The hotels restaurant &quot; The Coffee shop had poor service and blah quality food. We ate at the Treasure Island buffet our last evening in Vegas and my wife got food poisoning there. She ended up vomiting and in the bathroom to the point that we took and early flight home. This ruined our last day in Vegas. Upon arriving home we contacted Treasure Island to report this. The person we spoke to responded &quot;you waited till now to call&quot;. Now being a whole day and a half and btw kinda hard to call when your throwing up! They ended up taking a report and a supervisor was supposed to call us back. Two days later and we still have not heard back. Not only did we waste money on food that got us sick, it ruined our last day in Vegas and we had to spend hours waiting stand by in the airport so that we could fly home early. Treasure Islands lack of action clearly sounds that they do not care about their customers. We are returning to Vegas in Sept. and it most certainly will not be here!	3	4	-1	3	3	1	-1	3

No major complaints, but nothing to rave about either. Cleanliness left something to be desired. Ate at Coffee Shop for breakfast and found it somewhat overpriced. Also ate three meals at Kahunaville and found food, service, and ambiance outstanding at a much more reasonable price.. Our opinion of TI may have been skewed by the fact that we had spent the previous night at Harrah's, where we were upgraded to a suite. Paid about 25% of the TI rate, and no resort fee. TI is a decent property, but it seems as if you can do much better at the same price level or at the least equal quality for less money.	2	3	-1	3	2	3	-1	3

We broke our trip up and stayed at a property on the south end and then north end so we could walk to and see everything. TI's parking is great. Park in the garage, walk straight down the hall and escalator and you're in the casino and near the elevators. This place was crowded in the elevator areas and the casino area, but when we got to our room, nobody. Our room was quiet and comfortable. Very clean and we had a great view. We have stayed here before and had some noise issues, but not this time. They put us near the end of a hall . We did notice people smoking near the elevator area on our non smoking floor. People give it a rest! The bed was comfortable and everything else you need in a vegas room. We did have a refrigerator! This hotel is very convenient to it's end of the strip. This is why we stay here. They have several restaurants with reasonable food as well. We tried Gilley's this time which was great. I did have to wait even at the invited guest line to check in and out, but not long. For the price, this is a great place. You can spend more across the street at the Wynn or Venetian, but why? I do get decent offers from the Wynn, but have never received anything from the Venetian and have gambled there several times.	5	5	-1	5	4	5	-1	5

While stated on their website is a check in of 3 pm, this appeared to vary from day to day and was available at 12 pm as advertised in their lobby. I did notice other check in times of other days so this must depend on how busy it is. The hotel kindly held our bags until check in time allowing us to explore a little of Vegas prior to check in time.<br/><br/>If checking in at the same time as it opens, be prepared for a short 10 minute line. Check in went smoothly and we were placed on a non smoking floor. As you may already be aware, the price for your hotel isn't was is quoted and be prepared to pay tax and an additional resort fee of $25 per night which gives you access to many of the amenities whether you use them or not. I will note that the wi-fi connection fee is somewhat confusing, but be assured free wi-fi is included within your $25 per night resort fee.<br/><br/>The hotel is located within a large and busy casino. So be prepared to get a little lost, smell a little smoky and the ground floor busy with people.<br/><br/>The room was larger and much nicer than expected. We didn't pay extra for a view of The Strip and I can't say I missed much. We had a good view out the window of The Trump and Stratosphere along with some of the bright lights of Vegas.<br/><br/>The bed was a large king sized bed and was reasonably comfortable. I will note here that the bed sheets were not made to the full length of the bed and thus was a little rough feeling on your feet at the bottom. This was never rectified the entire length of our stay even though the room was serviced daily and bed made daily. However we slept very well and the bed and pillows were comfortable.<br/><br/>The room had a very large bathroom, with good sized mirror, bath/shower, basin and toilet. The only disappointment with the bathroom was the shower gel which didn't lather up and was an odd colour. While fine, I would of preferred a better product especially as it stated was their own recipe from their on-site spa. Didn't make me want to visit the spa.<br/><br/>The room had a wardrobe (closet), safe deposit, fridge, chairs, TV and tables. The room was large and comfortable and easy to spend a fair amount of time in. The windows had back-out curtains which would be essential in Vegas and thus easy to sleep in (although Vegas time is 11am - 2am usually).<br/><br/>The location of the hotel is in the centre of The Strip. This is probably the biggest asset for the hotel. It is located adjoining the Fashion Show shopping mall which is packed with designer and everyday clothing brand shops and accessories. This is easily accessed by a walkway over the road. It is opposite the Wynn (best buffet) and Venetian. A free tram is also available to The Mirage (which I think is the most pleasant casino to visit).<br/><br/>If you don't want to venture far, there is plenty to do at TI. There is a pool although we didn't have time to make use of this on this visit. There are two Starbucks one within the casino and outside. There are a number of restaurants within the casino including the buffet which was excellent for breakfast. The 24 hour coffee shop within the casino is reasonable and offers nearly all types of cuisine including food, drinks and snacks for any taste or desire you may have. We enjoyed a hearty breakfast of pancakes, bacon and eggs here which is without complaint along with a late dinner which was enjoyable. The service is varied with some staff excellent while others need improvement.<br/><br/>Security is provided at the elevators after 9 pm where you need to show a room card to access the elevators. This was not a problem to us but may be an issue if you have booked someone to visit you or have friends meeting you in your room.<br/><br/>We spent an entire night in the casino and had a good time on the slots and tables. The atmosphere is pleasant, classy while not too ritzy. We also saw Cirque De Soleil Mystere which is an absolute must and we thoroughly enjoyed. This show alone I would give 5 stars to. Unfortunately the 35% off for show tickets for hotel guests staying at TI wasn't available when I booked and I only got an email from the hotel for this offer on our last night after seeing the show so I booked it elsewhere online.<br/><br/>The Sirens of TI is a must to see and in my view is probably one of the best shows on The Strip. Certainly has all the elements of girls, explosions, fireworks, pirates, song and dance.<br/><br/>My only real complaint would be that on one occasion the room service staff did not leave us any soap and thus we had to rely on the horrible shower gel. This was a little disappointing and I do hope it wasn't due to the fact that I didn't have $2 that day to leave the room service staff for a tip so I only left $1.<br/><br/>I would also of liked to have free coffee / tea making facilities. Room service can provide this, but the cost ($15 for a jug of boiling water) makes this very expensive and we instead had to go to Starbucks for coffee and tea. Strangely you can get free ice from the corridors and water/soda from vending machines but no tea or coffee.<br/><br/>We had a fantastic time in Las Vegas and Treasure Island was a great hotel. Having visited some other hotels and casinos, I was very happy with our choice and would probably stay here again.	4	5	-1	4	5	3	-1	4

The service at this hotel is awful. One &amp; half hours booking in, 1-hour booking out. Only a handful of staff working behind the counter, even when they can see a line of 50 + people trying to get service.<br/><br/>When you ask for help at TI, your typical response is &quot;it's not my department, go over there&quot;, only to find that &quot;over there&quot;, nobody exists. TI staff seems reluctant to help outside of their remit. <br/><br/>We were unable to use their Internet - we could log in but it took well over 10-minutes just to load a single web page. We raised this with front desk and were given some silly excuse that because Vegas is in a valley, they suffered from poor connectivity sometimes. Yet the Stratosphere and Wynn were fine. TI then charge you a $25.00 per day + tax resort fee, most of which, by their own admission, covers the internet charge.<br/><br/>The Buffet was just disappointing. Compared with many Vegas hotels which charge such a high Buffet price, the variety at TI was very limited. Absolutely nothing to write home about here.<br/><br/>The hotel is also showing its' age as well and looks like it could do with a decent make-over. It is very dark, even in the rooms. Depressing.<br/><br/>I could write so much about what is wrong with TI and little-to-nothing about what is good about it, so for brevity sake, I'll leave it at that.	2	4	-1	3	3	1	-1	3

Buffet is too expensive for what is offered...breakfast at the buffet was good but lunch/dinner offerings limited--it is a small buffet. I should mention that if you are a dessert lover that section of the buffet is really, really good. Chocolate fountain for your fruit and I've even seen them offer cotton candy! TI does offer plenty of other dining options. The convenience of getting to your room from the lobby through the casino is nice. You do have a more secure feeling in the evening going to your room with security agents checking room keys before allowing elevator access. The hotel rooms were updated about 3 years ago and already showing signs of wear. Bathrooms are very small, shower awful but the beds are fairly comfortable. Pool access is a walk--you have to go through a good portion of the casino and through the shopping area to get there. Great pool area but access again is awfully inconvenient but typical. If you get a good rate...stay but don't pay too much there are plenty of affordable places to stay in Vegas.	3	5	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

The room service was great - the prices were more reasonable than other hotel room services I've tried, and the service was fast. The food was also really good! The casino is just OK - not the nicest that Las Vegas has to offer. There were also so many children there, I was shocked. Why bring kids to a Vegas casino?? Other than that, it was nice to have two Starbucks on-site, and it's easy to get to the Venetian, Wynn and other nearby places. Convenient to have Walgreens right across the street as well.

Sometimes as much as 5-6 times a year. Our main hotel of choice has been Venetian or Palazza wth my favourite being Encore. This time we got a comp and a good deal at Treasure Island and decided to take it. We were there for 5 nights. I honestly didn't expect much as I know it isn't one of the higher end hotels. I was pleasantly surprised. The room was not huge but it was spacious enough. The bathroom was fine. Enough counterspace for both of our toiletries. The room had a king bed, chaise lounge and another chair which was not a computer type chair which was nice for the other person to sit in. The room had a small fridge which held at least a dozen beer! What a bonus in a Las Vegas hotel room! The only thing about the room which I could not understand was the SMALL size of the t.v. It was a flat screen on the wall but it was sooooo small! This day and age when flat screens can be bought so cheap to have such a small one in the room was chintzy! I know you don't go to Vegas to watch t.v. but for those times when you might feel a bit gambled out and just want to take it easy that little tiny t.v. didn't cut it. Pool area was nice. Other than that I have nothing negative to say about Treasure Island and I would definitely stay there again if I got a great deal. <br/><br/>The other hotels in Las Vegas that I have stayed in are: Excalibur, Luxor, Imperial Palace, Monte Carlo, Mirage, Venetian, Palazzo and Encore. Encore being the best and Luxor being the absolute worse! You will notice with a lot of the Las Vegas hotels they charge a resort fee. That resort fee covers the cost of using their fitness facility, most of the time a newspaper and wifi in your room. Most of the higher end hotels say that you have to pay this resort fee and it is not negotiable. Treasure Island did not make you pay this resort fee unless you wanted to use the fitness or the wifi. There were not hot spots anywhere in the hotel to get wifi and the starbucks in Treasure Island or around that area did not provide wifi. Therefore if you need or want wifi you had to pay. We did get it for one day and the cost was $17.99 for 24 hours. <br/><br/>Feel free to message me with any questions about the above hotels. <br/><br/>One tip - please remember that most if not all of the hotels in Las Vegas do not provide coffee makers in the room. With the amount of rooms the hotels have and to supply coffee for all those coffee makers, they just won't do it. Also, they want you to go to Starbucks in their hotels. My husband and I love our coffee first thing in the morning, so we bought one of those small coffee makers that makes about 3 cups and I throw that in my suitcase every time we go to Vegas and a couple of cups and we have our coffee every morning! Just a tip!	5	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

We originally booked for a strip view room, but upon check-in elected to upgrade to a petite suite. While this didn't have a strip view, it was incredibly spacious with two separate closets and bathrooms (one bathroom had a jacuzzi tub and the other an incredible marble shower with a seat). The bed was very comfortable (we prefer softer beds and this bed certain fit the bill) however the pillows were annoying (feather pillows - double up and your fine). We had stayed 2 yrs ago in this same hotel and with the addition of Senior Frogs, the hotel was more &quot;festive&quot; this trip but it's still small enough not to get lost in. <br/><br/>We also love it's location - immediately across from the Venetian and Palazzo, next to the mirage and just a simple bus ride anywhere else (we were there in 40C weather - walking up and down the strip was tortorous in the heat. We highly recommend buying a bus past at $7/24hrs or a 1 week pass). The bus stop going North is just across the street and across from the Fashion Show Mall and the bus stop going south strip is just on the otherside of the pedestrian overpass outside the main entrance to the hotel - very easy. In general we only ate at the hotel 1x/day for breakfast and usually at the cafe (sorry, can't remember the name). The service was poor and the attitudes of the staff left much to be desired, but it was easy access and we continued to return. We also went to the Cirque du Soleil show (Mystere) for our second time but were somewhat disappointed due to changes to the show. Still, was easy to purchase tickets the same day as the show and I do recommend seeing the the show. Valet service at this Hotel is easy as was check-in and out. Upon check in at 1pm it was may a 15 minute wait in line and 2-3 minutes getting set up with keys, etc. We will still continue to favor this Hotel/Casino but we think the next time we go we will try the Belaggio as it continues to draw us in and is perfectly situated in the heart of the strip. <br/><br/>As a final note, the Sirens show nightly never interested us. We saw it once 2 yrs ago, did not enjoy the silly thing and have recommended to many people to skip it - there are much better free shows up and down the strip.	5	4	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

Treasure Island is in my opinion the best Hotel in vegas for a couple of reasons. 1) The location is great, its right smack in the middle of the vegas strip walking distance from anywhere you wanna go. 2) The rooms are the cleanest I have ever seen. 3) EVERYONE who works there has a great attitude. The dealers are funny and have all kinds of rhymes and sayings especially at the craps tables. This one of the few casinos you can go to and even the pit bosses are kind. 4) The room I stayed in was a strip view on the 34th floor and it was awesome. At first I was sort of worried about staying that high up thinking that I would be waiting for a long time for elevators but I dont remember ever waiting more than maybe 15 or 20 seconds for an elevator. 5) The casinos have reasonable limits. Why go across the street to a more expensive place and be forced to play $50 blackjack and have dealers give you a hard time about everything? 6) The pool awesome. I just wish it stayed open a little later. Overall, I was highly satisfied with my stay and will recommend it anyone who asks.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Got served by a VERY miserable barmaid in Gillies, who seemed to be most aggrieved that I tried to order drinks. Gillies bar seemed like fun but on the evening we were there it was bikini bull riding but seemed like fun at first but soon descended into a seedy event where the first girl was belittled because she refused to strip and subsequent girls were clearly a paid part of the act. The guy hosting it was a complete tool and about as entertaining as kidney failure. Management would do well to take heed of these comments.<br/><br/>The pool looked fine if you wanted to drink weak yellow beverages and go wooo a lot.<br/><br/>The room was very nice, it was a good size and the decor was tasteful, and included a fridge and a safe.<br/><br/>We had to queue for about 35 minutes to check in which was somewhat arduous.<br/><br/>I know this sounds like I am a bit down on TI but I did enjoy my stay there, I posted the negative comments in the hope that TI management read them and act to improve the few shortfalls in their otherwise impressive hotel	3	5	-1	5	5	3	-1	5

Do Not Recommend.	3	3	Firstly, the room was meant to be a delux strip view room. The only thing that lived up to that description was the Stip view. The room however was far from delux. Firstly, the two double beds were the most uncomfortable Las Vegas beds we've ever slept in. Secondly, my room rate was inclusive of the resort fees however was forced to pay this again as i didn't have the voucher to prove this. Now that I'm home and have this I am faced to contact TI for a refund which I'm sure will land on deaf ears as everything else has in their hotel if their staff is to go by. The checkin staff was anything but welcoming. With all the competition in Las Vegas, how this hotel operates the way it does is beyond me. There is by far many more hotels in and around the same price range but offering superior service. Take your $$ where it will be more appreciated.<br/>Room was 32101. Nice view of the strip (thats about it). Bath basin has very slow water drainage so when having shower you feel like you're standing in your own waste as the bath fills with water faster than it can drain. I did bring this up to their 'engineering' department, but they were obviously too busy with other things during my 6 day stay to even come up and have a look.	3	5	-1	3	3	1	-1	1

We got a great deal on our trip package and were not quite sure what to expect at TI. Our flight arrived to Vegas by 11 AM and we worried about checking in to our hotel because check in times are usually later. When we arrived to the hotel there was a sign at the front on the lobby that said something along the lines of &quot;Courtesy of our guests, check in time has been changed to 10 AM&quot;. We were surprised and happy about this so we could check in right away, settle in, and hit the strip!<br/><br/>The resort fee that we paid was quite high for what was included. However, we received a &quot;2 for 1&quot; buffet voucher for TI's buffet. The food was very good here. There was even &quot;all you can drink champagne&quot; that afternoon for $4. <br/><br/>Our first day we went to &quot;Gilleys&quot; which is a restaurant/bar located in TI. When we got to the restaurant we asked to sit on the patio and the hostess said we could only sit out there if we were eating, otherwise we would have to sit in the bar. I guess this is a common thing on the strip, however I was surprised and disappointed considering the patio was completely empty. <br/><br/>Our room was very simple and clean with a nice view of the strip. <br/><br/>We really loved the location of Treasure Island on the strip. It is right close to a lot of the other hotels and casinos and easy access to the other side of the strip as well.<br/><br/>I would 100% suggest seeing the show &quot;Mystere&quot; which is actually featured in Treasure Island. When purchasing tickets we also got a discount because we were staying at the hotel so that was also a bonus. I have only seen one Cirque show before but this one (Mystere) blew our last experience out of the water. The acrobatics were incredible, and the show overall was amazing. <br/><br/>The casino was nice, however not much luck there AT ALL, so we chose to gamble at other casinos. The drink service while gambling here was somewhat slow we found as well. <br/><br/>On our last day our flight wasn't until 11 PM. The hotel would not allow us to check out late which was understandable because it was a Saturday and they were most likely booked. However we were impressed with the service that we received where they stored our luggage for the whole day. They even let us access our bag to grab a change of clothes in the middle of the day. When we returned to get our bags at 9 PM so we could head to the airport the person that got our bags for us brought us right to the front of the Taxi Stand line (which was VERY long) so that we did not have to wait and therefore so we wouldn't be late for our flight. <br/><br/>Overall we had a great experience at TI. The staff were very helpful and the room, restaurant, and casino was very nice.<br/><br/>I would stay at TI again 100%.	3	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

I was getting married the day I arrived. I sent my dress to be steamed to the bell desk to be done on a rush service..it wasnt back in time so they demaned I pay nothing and got the service for free to the cleaning service they use. other than that..the rooms are great, very updated and modern. Pool is nice although 90.00 for a cabana seems pricey to me, and the drinks at the pool are a little pricey but that is vegas..eat off the strip if you can...its so pricey. we ate at TGIF which is at the Gold coast, near the RIO. if you have a car , its great food, great prices, and not that far. I would definitely stay here again just cause the customer service was outstanding for the few mistakes that were made.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Long line during peak check-in time but that's not unusual.

The hotel was very clean and comfortable. The room was beautiful. If Ihad to do it again I would not have stayed in a hotel with a casino. We were traveling with our two daughters and this was not the best hotel for that. We arrived on a Saturday night and the atmosphere was much wilder than we had anticipated.<br/><br/>Overall though this is a beautiful hotel with many shops and attractions. The location is right in the thick of things on the strip and was within walking distance of most of the other hotels. We were able to easily walk to see all the other hotels and their attractions. <br/><br/>We would recommend this hotel.	4	4	-1	5	4	4	-1	4

Not what we wanted after a long day of traveling.<br/><br/>The Internet only worked half the time.<br/><br/>One day the Maid did not come.<br/><br/>We called reception to complain but gave up after 15 minutes on hold.<br/><br/>The buffet breakfast is actually cheaper at the Bellagio.<br/><br/>Previously we stayed at Excalibur and I think it was much better value for the money.<br/><br/>The sirens show finishes at 11.50 so if you want an early night do not choose a strip view room as it is very loud.?	2	3	-1	3	5	1	-1	4

We got in late at night on a Thursday (10:00 p.m.), and check-in was at least a 30-minute wait, which was a tad annoying. We got up to the room, and it was a room that appeared to be only half-cleaned. There were clean sheets on the beds, but no bedskirts or duvet/bedspread, no towels in the bathroom, money on the floor, trash in the trashcan. We were given a new room and the front desk arranged for champagne to be sent to the room as a courtesy, but we gave up after midnight and it never arrived. Room was nicely decorated, with a view of the shopping mall across the street, and because it was west-facing it was HOT in the early evenings. Beds were SUPER comfortable and bathroom was adequate. Enjoyed the location, being in the middle of the strip, and that this is not a huge mega resort, so its quick to get in and out of the room. We tried to go to the pool on Sunday morning around 10 am, and that was a joke - every square inch was taken over by college-age drunk kids. Parking garage at the TI was super easy to use and we always found a close spot. The pizza shop between the garage and the lobby is good, but other than that, we didn't try anything on site. Upon checkout, we found out the $25 resort fee is really $28, because they tax it. Also, line to check out at 11 am on a Monday took entirely too long as well. It appears they need more front desk staff. Overall, was a nice stay, clean &amp; comfy, but nothing real special, especially when we had to dole out another $112 in resort fees on top of our already pre-paid rates.	3	5	-1	4	4	3	-1	5

It was a large suitcase so it was odd the way they carried back to us. they had to use the handle on the side. We filed a complaint with security. it took them over an hour to drag themselves out to us to walk us back in to write. Complaint. They have given us the run around for over two months. Now we just received a letter saying sorry we don't have proof that it was broken. We can't compensate you the $75 bucks and please don't let this deter you from visiting us gain. Are they kidding&quot; They lied, covered themselves by placing a false tag saying it was broken, made us wait for security and gave us the run around.

I signed their guestbook and got an excellent deal. When we arrived around 8pm on a Thursday evening, the check in line wasn't bad. I went to many other hotels during our stay and their check-in lines were also long at times. Remember, this is Vegas and thousands of people are coming in and going out! Who wouldn't expect some wait time? We waited probably about 10 minutes. The guy, Josh, that checked us in was really nice and even gave us a free bottle of champagne! The room was average, two beds, which was super comfy, a tv, nightstands, the usual. I wouldn't say the room wast super fancy but it was clean and pretty average. I'm very particular about where I lay my head and take my showers and this room passed! The best thing I can say about Treasure Island is that it is in a great location! There's even a mall next door. The worst thing I can say about the hotel is the Sirens of TI show. DO NOT waste your time seeing this even though it is free. The most ridiculous, corny show/pathetic musical I've ever seen! Other than that, I had a great stay and will definitely stay there again. Oh and as far as the 25.00 a day resort fee, every hotel I looked up had a resort fee ranging from 18.00-25.00 so it's kinda hard to get around that no matter where you stay.	4	5	-1	3	4	5	-1	5

Free highspeed internet, 2 free Buffet coupons(I think this was because I was upset with the $28 fee), a free pass to the awesome fitness center, a $20 coupon off future stay at TI, a 2-for-1 buffet coupon, 2-for-1 cocktail voucher and useless stuff like free newspaper, copies, faxes, free phone calls.<br/><br/>TI is a classy hotel. The rooms are very well designed, and all furnishing and carpeting are upscale. Up on the 23rd floor, I had an amazing birds eye view of the strip.

This hotel is at the strip with Mirage at the right and Venetian in front of it. We knew that the check-in time was 3 pm and we had reached early at 10 am. Hence we had planned to check in the luggage and come back at 3 pm. But to our surprise, they told us that as it was a holiday season, they have started to check-in at 10 am itself. A +5 there. There was a long line at the check-in, but there were 7 counters, hence it took around 20 mins from the line to reach the counter. Even if I didnt like the idea, I had to pay the $25 resort fee. We were given a pool facing room at the 12th floor.The room, its bed, bathroom, towels everything was clean. No complains. Did nothing much at the hotel, as we were out most of the time. But used the lunch Buffet and restaurant breakfast vouchers (got with the $25 resort fee). The buffet at TI was good and tasty. Also there were many restaurants inside the hotel itself which were good. The number of Elevators are more in this hotel, making the wait time less. As it was vacation time and the hotel rooms were sold-out, the check-out line was even longer than I expected. I was sure that it would take 50-60 mins to checkout. But one of the staff came and told us that if we do not require a bill, we can just drop the keys in the drop-box and the check-out will be done. This, thus saved our lot of time. A +5 again. Overall a good hotel to stay in and will definitely recommend it.	5	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

Putting that aside, I will give you my opinion of the hotel. Just pulling into valet parking was a nightmare! Jam packed with people, and cars, but I think they did a pretty good job of moving it along. Check in was another nightmare, the longest lines and wait I have ever experienced. The restaurants were ridiculously priced. $14.50 for two eggs, Really? We went across the street to Walgreens and bought some food as did many other people, it was packed! The room itself was not impressive. Thankfully, it was quiet, and the beds were comfortable. Overall, the room was not horrible, but the bathroom was not very clean. We were only there for one night. The next morning when we were going down to find some coffee, the maid asked us when we were checking out. check out wasn't until 12:00, nothing like being rushed out the door! We told them probably not til 11:30, and they were literally waiting in the hall for us to leave! I understand they have a job to do but really? Anyway, I'm sure you can find nicer. Pay the extra money and stay at someplace like the Wynn!	2	3	-1	2	2	1	-1	3

The rooms are nice for the price you pay to stay right on the strip in Vegas. Good location because it's close to other hotels/casinos. Venetian, Palazzo, Mirage, Wynn and Encore are all super close and have a vareity of restuarants, shops and shows available. Casino is smoky, but that's expected in Vegas. <br/><br/>Major plus: there's a Starbucks and Margarita bar on property! Great way to end and start the day!	4	5	-1	4	4	3	-1	3

As I entered the room on the 35th floor, it looked a bit odd. One bed was made up and the other was missing the duvet. I didn't think much of it until one of my kids decided to use the washroom. The toilet was literally full of crap and toilet paper...no lie. I was completely disgusted. I called the front desk and whoever I talked to was only going to send up a house keeping supervisor. I asked for a new room. The front desk told me they were completely full. When my husband returned from parking the car, he called. All of a sudden there were rooms available. Really?? <br/><br/>We switched rooms to the 15th floor. The room was ok. Beds were old and lumpy. <br/><br/>The first five minutes of our stay destroyed any possibility of enjoying our stay at the hotel.<br/><br/>At check out, I asked if they could compensate us by reducing the rate. Nope they sure couldn't. All they could do was drop the resort fee. Really? How would they feel if they had the same experience as our family?	2	3	-1	1	1	2	-1	2

I don't know how it can ever be considered a luxury hotel. TI smells like smoke everywhere including the elevators and hallways. It's gross! The worst part about it is that there are drunk men everywhere you turn when you try to return to your hotel room at night. Why? Because the hotel rooms are so cheap, and TI happens to be in the middle of all these ritzy nightclubs and bars. You get what you pay for. If you're a woman, you should automatically avoid this hotel.	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1

We were there in late summer 2011. I had done some gambling in Louisiana in Shreveport but craved the Vegas experience. Treasure Island was a nice hotel. We had a petite suite and it was very lovely. The only issue was a non-working mini fridge and they fixed it for us right away. The staff was accommodating. The room was huge and so was the bathroom. Loved the giant tub! My husband enjoyed the room and we broke even at the casino. Won some money at Caesar's too :-). You almost can't beat the location. There is a walgreen's right across the street for convenience. It was nice to pick up things we might need. I can't comment on the Treasure Island Pirate Show though. There were so many people there that even guests of the hotel didn't get the promised views. They were pretty rude about it. However, everything else about the stay was nice. I am heading back to Vegas but staying at the Mirage this time, only because of a special deal we are getting. I still plan on staying at TI again someday :-)	4	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	4

We couldn't believe it, the middle of the Vegas strip and both the valet and the self park was free! Just outstanding. Excellent check in, not sure about walking through the whole of the casino to get to the check in desk if you self park but not a major problem. Choice of rooms, floors, bed; you name it we got it! <br/><br/>When we got to the room we decided to pay for the resort fee for the high speed Internet however we soon realised this was a waste as the Internet does not cooperate with Apple devices and as our devices were apple we decided to cancel the fee and continue with our stay (which was done easily.) <br/><br/>Vegas is incredible! Our first time there and it won't be our last! Everything was amazing, alcohol on the streets, pizza at 3am, there was never a dull moment! We enjoyed walking up the strip and going into all the casinos and hotels! <br/><br/>Main good points; the city that never sleeps, cirque du solei (mystique) and overall Vegas experience<br/><br/>Low points; very low ceilings made smoke almost unbearable (but that's it!!)	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

We have stayed at the TI several times in the past and always had a great experience. We didn't experience many of the problems others posted about. Check-in took awhile, but we expected a wait considering it was a Saturday. Our room was clean when we checked in, and was cleaned by the staff every day. When we needed extra towels they were brought up in a timely manner. I am not a smoker, and did not think the hotel or the casino smelled smokey at all. We found the beds to be heavenly, and our room was very quiet.<br/><br/>The only negatives I will mention are: 1) the pool seemed pretty cloudy. Other times we have stayed there the pool was crowded, but the water still seemed crystal clear. This time the water quality seemed a bit off. I also wish they would section off a part of the pool for kids to use. Kids splashing in the pool don't bother me if I'm at Disney World, but I don't like it in Las Vegas! Most of the people (without kids) that were near us in the pool felt the same way. There wasn't an over-abundance of kids in the pool and, again, if I were anywhere else it wouldn't have bothered me as much, but it would have been nice if most of the pool was reserved for adults only. 2) our favorite restaurant at TI, Isla, is closing. We had always had excellent Mexican food at Isla and can't believe the next time we are in Vegas we will not be able to eat there. <br/><br/>We only went to the buffet a couple of times for breakfast, and it seemed like it wasn't as abundant as other years. We had our buy one, get one free coupon so it wasn't so bad. However, the breakfast at Kahunaville was very reasonable and tasty. It was very easy to get two for one drink coupons for Kahunaville from a gal standing right outside the door, too!<br/><br/>One of the reasons I like the Treasure Island is that it is a smaller property. You don't have to walk several blocks just to get into your hotel. There is easy access to the Fashion Show Mall across the street, and it's easy to get to the Mirage by taking the free tram. It's also a plus that Walgreen's is right across the street, and it's connected to a 24-hour Starbucks. <br/><br/>All in all, we didn't experience any of the bad things others had posted about. Our stay was just fine!	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	5

To begin with, there was a 45 minute line just to check in. I had booked the room well in advance, paid the deposit, yet had to wait, nonetheless. Furthermore, upon arriving in our room, there was spoiled food left in the &quot;mini-refrigerator&quot; from a prior patron. Also, there was urine all over the seat of the toilet. When I called the front desk, they said we could come back down and get another room. I was not about to stand in that line again! I cleaned the area<br/><br/>Also, the hall on the 32nd floor smelled of marijuana. I am traveling with a family. i pointed this out to a cleaning person, and she just shrugged. This was Las Vegas!<br/><br/>Otherwise, actually everything went well. The staff were helpful (except for the check-in process). The buffet was great. The coffee shop provided good service and food, even late at night. The Cirque de Soleil Mystere show was phenomenal.<br/><br/>Maybe I just had a bad experience with the room, but when paying the prices we paid, I expected more.	3	5	-1	4	2	3	-1	5

I prefer the modern and new furnishings at TI over the dated and worn rooms at Paris. I read the comments about the long check-in lines at TI. I have never encountered this because I walk right up to the counter where the &quot;Invited Guests&quot; sign is. If you made your reservation because of an email or other offer, that's where you go. No wait and a cheerful greeting. We have always asked for and received a strip view without any extra charge, something we had to pay for at Paris. The pool area has plenty of seating, but you may have to move chairs around as they are lined up with no room in between. By the late afternoon on a hot day the water is cloudy with sunscreen, so an early visit is better.	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1

No probs with noise/smoke etc. the service however was probably the worst I have ever experienced in 43 yrs of regular travel. I should mention that I did come across one very helpful and nice bellhop though, so not all bad. The pool area was nice but smallish and very crowded- too many people for the size of the pool.<br/><br/>Firstly, it took over an hour to check in. I tried to be positive and when it was my turned smiled and said, ' wow, aren't you busy' but my receptionist didn't even look up, let alone talk to me. The bare minimum of curt instructions were given and I was sent to my room feeling like I was in trouble! I know it was busy and she probably felt harassed but it is supposed to be a 'service' industry , and I was actually paying wasn't I?<br/><br/>However, my main issue is that stupid, bogus, yes you guessed it, RESORT FEE. What a complete have. It's just another tax and should be put in with the price of the room. It's mandatory, so why not be upfront? I knew about it, so it wasn't a surprise, but it is just so incredibly bogus that it really annoyed me. I got a pretty good price for my rooms and would have been just as happy to pay $28 per day more in the first place, without all this trickery! Let me describe the 'resort fee'...<br/>We had two adjoining rooms- one for us, and one for the kids (6,8,10 yr). The fee was $28 per room per night. I felt that we should not have had to pay this for the kids room as most of the services the fee offered were not relevant to children. This is roughly what my $224 covered...<br/><br/>1)A newspaper per room each day ( my non-American 6 yr old is not really intersted in US politics, but should he take a sudden interest ( and learn to read better!), then he doesn't really need his own copy he can use ours, which we weren't using anyway.<br/>2). A 2 for 1 cocktails voucher per room (1 for the whole stay, not per day as the resort fee is). Spot the obvious issue I had here with paying for this. Hmm, wonder if the bar tender would let my kids use the one for their room? Other problem here was the voucher said it could be used at various bars, but when we took it to the outside bar at the 'kahunaville' to enjoy a cocktail by the pool, the bartender said that it could ony be used at the 'inside bar' of the same establishment! Why? Didn't say anything on the voucher about inside versus outside bars.I'd be curious to know the reason for this?<br/>3) some kind of deal about joining a gambling club and getting free chips....minimum age 21 , but yes, the kids room still had to pay it even though they can't legally use it,<br/>4) use of the fax, photocopier and business centre, - useful for all those business meetings the kids will be dealing with.<br/>5) 2 for 1 buffet( only 1 per stay also) - the catch? It can only be used on adult meals so actually on breakfast only would have saved $2 if we used them at the same time, and given it was one for our room and one for the kids I figure we should be able to use them at the same time.<br/>6) Internet access. Welcome to the 21 st century - even starbucks does free wifi! We had one laptop, which we used in our room and I'm sure my kids aren't the only 6,8,10 yrs olds without their own I phones are they? Once again - it doesn't matter. Should we have suddenly decided to buy them a laptop each, they could use the wifi at the hotel!<br/>7) 2 trips to the gym. - what? Isn't a gym standard in any hotel these days?<br/>8) boarding passes printed - this was actaully quite useful ( but works out as an expensive boarding pass given its the only thing we were able to use other than the wifi)<br/>8) VArious other things too irrelevant to remember.<br/><br/>Shame, because it was a nice hotel and we really liked the rooms and location. It should have been a good experience but we were left with the overwhelming feeling that the staff just didn't really care about the clients at all. The resort fee package seemed to have so many caveats on it that it made it hard to use even if you were interested.<br/><br/>I would never consider staying here again. I just can't believe the whole resort fee thing is even a legal way of pricing as its so obviously misleading- giving the sense of being optional but is actually just another mandatory tax.	3	4	-1	4	3	1	-1	4

I have stayed at treasure Island twice... once back in Sept. of 2010 and again in June of 2011. This hotel is good if you are on a budget. I do prefer to stay at places like the Wyn and encore but my pocket book tells me different. Its in a great location. Rooms at treasure Island are good nothing special. For the most part they are pretty clean. The beds are comfortable. The room sizes are good. The rooms are pretty basic. I don't spend much time in my room when I'm in Vegas. The hotel casino is fine not much of a gambler so didn't spend much time in the casino. The casino does have somewhat of a distinct smell to it not horrible but it does smell kind of old. The pool is nice to lay out at. I have eaten several times at the coffee shop which was pretty good and the prices were not too bad for Vegas. The Khunaville bar is pretty good for drinks and the prices are a little less than some bars -especially if you can get those 2 for one drink coupons they sometimes pass out. Did eat once here but the food was not that great. If you are looking for value for a decent hotel this would be the place.	3	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	4

Okay. Average. That's about the best/most I can say about it.<br/><br/>The hotel is ... a hotel. The casino is a casino. The service is totally basic, no one on staff seems particularly concerned about what what you need or want, nor do they give the appearance of being particularly concerned about the job they're doing.<br/><br/>The room was a fine size. The bathroom is nice. The beds are decently comfortable. However, I had some very suspicious looking staining on my comforter and blankets (I got them replaced) and the chair in the room was too stained and gross to even sit on, so we used it for our luggage.<br/><br/>We paid extra for the &quot;Strip View&quot; which I would not necessarily recommend, Our view was a bunch of parking garages and the strip was only visible if you stood in one corner of the window and basically pressed yourself up against it.<br/><br/>The casino itself was never really packed or that busy. The most people I ever saw gambling there was at 3:30 AM when I was headed out to the airport.<br/><br/>The pool looked packed every time I saw it, and I never even made it out there to really check it out. I don't entirely know what I paid the $25/day resort fee for. I guess the not- entirely-reliable internet service?<br/><br/>Overall, things were fine. It was a place to sleep for a few hours and keep our luggage. Would I stay there again? No, I wouldn't. I visited most of the hotels along the Strip and found several I liked better.	3	3	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

The hotel room was clean, moderately spacious, and well-appointed. The check in was slow, with a long line. The hotel clerk was courteous, albiet when I questioned the resort tax of $25 plus tax on the resort fee, she merely stated, &quot;All of the Vegas hotels are charging resort fees&quot;. When I checked out and questioned the tax on the resort fee, another clerk responded in essence by saying that's the way it is. Customer service at TI is generally blase to the point of discourteous. The customer is really not number 1. <br/><br/>Vegas is losing many customers and still finds ways to lose more via &quot;resort fees&quot;, higher food costs, and other costs. If the tourist money continues to dry up, Vegas may be another ghost town in the desert. <br/><br/>Another note: Do not book on Tingo. The customer service advisor were unclear on resort fees. She also informed me that Tingo could not match any web based specials by hotels; Treasure Island had better rates on line. This was my first attempt and last attempt to book a hotel or any other travel arrangements via Tingo.	3	4	-1	4	4	1	-1	4

We found it to be good value for the money spent although there were a few hitches. We arrived around 10:00 p.m. and check in was very slow. The first night we found two ants in our bed, one of which bit my husband. We had problems with the t.v., which was eventually replaced, as well as with the safe which needed resetting. The staff was very accommodating and punctual in rectifying these problems. We contacted the front desk with our complaints and they waived the $28 resort fee for two of the four nights. Not really sure why the resort fee is there in the first place other than it's easy money for the hotel. The room was clean and in good condition and the bed was comfortable. The pool was not large but adequate. The casino itself could use a makeover. Many of the other hotels have much nicer ones. We ate at the Buffet restaurant once and I wouldn't return. The location of TI is great as it's an easy walk to The Bellagio, Mirage, Casear's Palace and the Fashion Show Mall. All in all our stay at TI was fine, but next time we're in Vegas we will try another resort.	4	4	-1	4	4	3	-1	4

We came in for 2 nights and wanted to see Celine at the Ceaser's, we were looking for something reasonably priced and yet within walking distance.<br/>The TI runs specials through their website and that's where we found to find the best deals. HOWEVER, before booking it directly go to an airline that you may have rewards with (Southwest or United) and they often feed from the same specials but you can still earn points. <br/><br/>ROOM- They were renovated 2005-2006 and look very presentable, spacious, and comfortable. <br/>LOCATION- Right on the strip, 3 casinos down from the Bellagio fountains. Shopping Forums across the street, to the right, and at Ceaser's. <br/>POOL- A bit small, nice enviroment with some music but NOT the party scene. Mostly adults when we were there.<br/>RESTAURANT- Disappointing, poor lighting gives an impression of a run down place. VISIT the Grand Lux Cafe at the Venetian (across the street) it's one of the BEST places we've ever visited. It's a sister company of the Cheesecake Factory and it's open 24 hours, YES! One of the few places that serve good quality food after midnight. <br/>TI PIRATE SHOW- NO LONGER A CHILD FRIENDLY SHOW. Some adults may even be offended.<br/><br/>OVERALL- Great bargain, great location.<br/><br/>I hope this helps :)	4	5	-1	4	3	5	-1	4

We paid $60/night and we would return back to the TI for sure! The location is amazing. Located on the centre of the strip and a Walgreens is located just across the road (which sells everything!) The rooms were nice and clean and the pool area was very nice although is was a little small and there were no pool floaties available.

We've stayed at Treasure Island 4 times over the years. We have stayed at a lot of the hotels on the strip but we keep going back to TI. We always stay in their &quot;Petite Suite&quot;. It's about 630 sq ft. but it's very spacious with an open feeling. It has all the amenities you would need. There is a huge/wide entrance into the room. There is a large desk and chair - all set up for business, if you have to. There is a sitting couch with a coffee table, a wall mounted flat screen TV, and a small &quot;bar&quot; (high top table and chairs). The suite features TWO full sized bathrooms. Yes, TWO! One has a huge jetted tub and the other has a step down glass/tile shower. Both have double sinks, toilets and roomy closets. Absolutely fabulous. And the bed... Oooh the bed. The bed is a little slice of heaven all on it's own. It's like sleeping on a cloud. Even if you've had a long night, you wake up feeling great.<br/><br/>There are great eating choices in TI. There's a Starbucks, a Ben and Jerry's, a deli, a coffee shop and a buffet. Kahunaville, Se?or Frog's and Gilley's BBQ are all fun and all have good food. Phil's Italian Steak House is supposed to be superb but we have never eaten there.<br/><br/>We like to walk across the street, over to the Venetian. The bars are cool to hang out at there, and have great bartenders. We have walked (as long as the weather allows) as far as Flamingo to Jimmy Buffet's a few times. It seems long but it's really not a bad walk.<br/><br/>Now for the bad: The view is horrible - roof tops of parts of TI and other buildings around. The service desk is EXTREMELY poor and SLOOOOOOW. A 30-45 minute check in/check out time is unacceptable for a hotel of this size. They need to staff extra employees for busier seasons. Ridiculous. We do express check out because when we are ready to go home, we want to go home - not wait another 30-45 min's. The valet is usually on top of it. The bellmen are a little slow. On one stay, we waited almost an hour for our luggage.<br/><br/>We've never been to the pool or club, or any shows at TI so I can't comment on those.<br/><br/>Even though the service is lousy, we will continue to stay there on occasion. Great atmosphere, great beds, great eats, reasonably priced for what you get and conveniently close to other great hotels on the strip.	4	5	-1	4	4	2	-1	5

Check in was a cluster, and we were herded for an hour, told where we could and could not wait, and promised service that was not available. Once were finally allowed to queue, desk staff was inadequate to the task with only 3 agents. The bottom line, they need to renovate customer service. Pay a little more, give your business to a place that will make you feel like your business is appreciated, and not merely tolerated.	3	4	-1	4	4	2	-1	3

We booked a tower suite for a treat but was fairly disappointed with the room. I will give them credit for the size it was huge but it felt empty, the two bathrooms were large almost two large one had a spa bath and the other a wet area shower. The whole room was very dark and rather drab looking.When we arrived in our room I noticed alot of food left over from the previous occupiers down the sides of the couch which immediately made the whole room feel dirty.I rang the front desk and got a smart alec named Lindon I asked for a new room as this was dirty he told me no he will send up the housekeepers to clean it.I said no i am not happy with this room I would like another(we were told a few minutes ago at chekin there was another suite not quite ready) He denied this told me there was nothing available so basically tough. I asked him for his name as I wanted to see him face to face to sort this out he very smugly replied that he was in the back and I would not be able to talk to him (very brave behind a phone) I hung up on this smart ar*e and went down stairs complained and instantly got another room. Lindon you are a joke you are doing nothing good for this hotel and I hope you are moved on.He is the main reason why we will not return!	2	5	-1	2	1	1	-1	3

We used rental car and had no issues with valet, they were quick and never waited more than 7 minutes. Stayed on 25 floor so we were able to use second set of elevators so waiting was never an issue. Our room was located at the very end of hall so we had a corner room with large tall windows on both sides of wall. Our view was amazing! Could see the Mirage and past it the Bellagio with all their water and fire shows. Can be a bit noisy but really didn't bother us much. The hallways were quiet and never did hear our neighbors. The hotel spa shampoo, conditioner, soap, lotion, and eyepads for us gals was a nice touch. The casino layout was a bit confusing for the first 2 days, but we finally figured everything out.Catch the tram to the Mirage and then it is a short walk to Ceasars forum shops which stay open til 11pm. My favorite was the walkway (homeless tend to frequent here but they never bother anyone) to the Fashion Show Mall. I could be there in just a few minutes. We sometimes ate over there at the food court because the prices were so much more reasonable than the hotels restaurants. They have some really nice anchor stores, Saks, Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdales, Macys, Dillards, Nordstroms to name just a few. The 2 story Forever 21 store was awesome...almost as big as Lowes!!! The ABC store is a good place to get any necessities that you might have forgot. They also have snacks for your plane ride and $1 one liter water which is nice for the room or pool. Speaking of the pool, it was very nice. Lots of places to lounge, can be a bit close to your neighbors though. I tried to always get an end row seat. DJ showed up around 1pm and that was pretty fun. Went to the TI buffet....food was outstanding. However, be sure you go early as the lines get long at night. A bit pricey at $23.99 per person but hopefully you can pick up a B1G1 coupon. The variety is great from BBQ, pasta bar, create your own salad bar, seafood bar, and amazing dessert bar. Price includes soft drinks and tea. See the Mystere show that is located in TI if you can, it is a great Cirque show!!	4	5	-1	4	4	5	-1	4

We were lucky not to arrive when everyone else did, so we didn't have to wait to check in or get our room (and it was only 11 am) - nice service on the front desk too! Our room was a great size, the beds were comfortable, but the pillows weren't that comfortable (big, but lumpy and hard). We got an awesome view of the strip on the 29th floor. We loved the pool, although small, we always enjoyed a refreshing dip. Overall, great facilities. Still hate the smoking in the casinos (you get up to your room smelling of smoke) but hey it's Vegas after all! Would we stay here again? Perhaps, good value for money but they've got to keep up the deals to compete with all that's out there.	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1

We had rented a car from Mccaran, and did self-parking at the hotel. From the garage it was somewhat confusing to get to the hotel lobby as there was renovation inside the casino and some paths were blocked, but fortunately getting from the guest elevators to the garage wasn`t far. We were also able to get parking on the 4th floor near the elevators easily. Once we were at the lobby we had to wait 30 minutes to check-in as they were shortstaffed. The rooms were very nice and spacious - our room was on the 24th floor, 2 queen sized beds, close to the elevators. We had some issues with the bathtub drainage - we called housekeeping in the morning and it was fixed by the time we got back to the hotel later in the afternoon. The hotel buffet IMO was not worth the ~$25 pp, as the food wasn't good and we had to wait in line for about 20 minutes when there were many tables inside that were available, but the resort fee included a 2 for 1 voucher and we had another free voucher, so it wasn't as bad to pay the price of 2 for 4 people. The hotel had a tram to Mirage, and a bridge conveniently to the Fashion Show Mall. I would stay here again for the price, room and location.	5	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

The hotel is right next to Fashion Show Mall and centrally located on the Strip. The housekeeping does a great job, the room service was always faster than quoted, and the employees are all friendly. I've stayed at other hotels on the Strip and this hotel is a decent price with all the amenities. My only wish was that their pool was bigger, many of the other hotels boast way better pools.	5	5	-1	4	5	4	-1	4

The pool area is nice with huge mature palm trees. I would recommend renting a cabana for the day, the waitress service is well worth it. The pool is really small and when crowded it becomes cloudy and down right disgusting to the point where I wouldn't even put my toe in it. On the weekends the pool area becomes a party place with rowdy, drunken mayhem but you can get away from it, as there are lots of chairs.

We've accidentally dropped a bottle of sunscream on the bathroom floor and we noticed the floor wasn't even mopped after the cleaning lady went there. We had to leave her a note asking to mop the floor and give extra tip to have it cleaned. Some of the furniture is also stained. <br/>I've seen long lines in the check-in counter, but I guess that's not unusual to Vegas.	3	5	-1	3	2	3	-1	3

The location of this hotel is great, it's close to the Wynn, Venetian, Mirage, Ceaser's, and the Bellagio. Connected by outside walkway to the Fashion Valley Mall and by Tram to the Mirage. If you booked through their website, you probably get a better deal. You only pay for one room rate and cancellation within two or was it three days to avoid penalities. <br/><br/>Hotel: It's a little tired. you see the wear and tears in the hallway and the rooms. The beds were comfortable, although the rooms were small (we stayed in the standard room without view of the strip) it was comfortable for two guest, four maybe a little tight as your only option is to sit on the bed. We had two rooms (adjoining) which worked out for us, two in one room and one in the other. Bathrooms had plenty of counter space, good water pressure; hair dryer, safe, a mini fridge, and iron/board stored in the closet. Pretty quiet, didn't hear any slamming doors. I did hear the train the second night (Monday), didn't hear it on the first night (Sunday).<br/><br/>The resort fee is a rate killer, the way I see it it adds another $25.00 of the purchase rate; otherwise, the resort fee is useless unless you use all amenities as part of the resort fee. All (or most) hotel on the strip charge the &quot;resort fee,&quot; it's the price you pay if you stay on the strip.<br/><br/>Service: check-in was bad, the lines were long, but it move fast, if you wait until 3 pm or after, the lines get longer, try to check in when you first arrive. The clerk that checked us in was not friendly, she did not even explained the resort fee and the amenities, just gave us the envelope and our room keys. She didn't even ask if we want the credit card tied to the room, I assumed it was since she asked for my credit card, to my surprise, the bar wouldn't accept my room key because there were no credit card tied to it. The bell desk staff were fast, efficient and wonderful, they hold your luggage before check-in and hold for departure too, even mark your bags to get in front of the taxi line (departure only).<br/><br/>Restaurants: Before I go on, all eatery on or near the strip are pricey regardless if it just a burger and fries. With that said, the only restaurant I care for at TI is Canter's Deli. It was delicious and hardy. Plenty to share too! The others are ok, but go explore and get out of the hotel (unless, it's 108 outside).<br/><br/>Pool Access: Poor, you have to walked through the casino and shops/restaurants to get there. So cover up. No open food and drinks! Not one of the nicer pool but suffice if you need cool off in their hot summers (really hot!).<br/><br/>Casino: I played only slots, but they have a variety. The floor were never crowded and easy to get a machine or table.<br/><br/>Show: We didn't see any shows here, the free &quot;Siren&quot; show outside is usually packed and you have to get there early, don't walk through those doors before or during the show, it's crazy crowded.<br/><br/>Great location if you're new to Las Vegas and want to be at the center, but if don't care to be at the center of things, stay else way. For the price, it was pretty good value with the exception of the unavoidable &quot;resort fee.&quot; You would think the revenue they made from the resort fee, they can contribute to updating the old and tired airport!!	3	5	-1	3	3	3	-1	4

I selected 4 stars and on the strip and TI is what popped up. I was blown away by the value! The room was very modern and impeccable, plus the cleaning crew did a great job of sprucing up every day. All of the staff I encountered were genuinely friendly and very helpful. We stayed on the 23rd floor and had a nice view of the pool and some of the strip. The casino was great and was never really crowded, so you can easily play a table game or hit the slots. My girlfriend and I ate at the buffet for lunch with the coupon they give you at checkin, and although it wasn't the best in Vegas it was certainly good! The only downside to the hotel is that they only have one small pool which starts to get crowded after 11 am. Other than that, it was a great stay and a great value especially for $65!	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Staff was very friendly and room was always clean. Great location near other hotels and casinos, and across from mall. Breakfast was good, did not eat dinner or lunch on-site. Check-in was long (1 hour), but this is all about timing. We arrived around 4:00 pm. Around 5:00 pm the check-in was probably about 5-10 minutes. Seems like everyone arrived at once. Drinks around the pool are expensive, but did have some good 2 for one coupons on some meals and drinks. Arrived on Sunday and left on Wed.

UR135518416	2C8ACA1DB8B9FB607FEB0E4090AE770F	Treasure Island - TI Hotel & Casino	Las_Vegas_Nevada	2012-07-27	Excellent stay - Pleasant staff and clean room!	5	4	This was my first time in Vegas, but won't be my last! TI is a fantastic hotel with a quiet yet smokey casino. Our room was clean and comfy - the bed was excellent! Of course, there's going to be people checking high and low for scratches on desks and other mishaps in their room - I actually laugh a little when they complain about omg A SCRATCH on the WALL or OMGGGG NO COFFEE MACHINE?!! You're on vacation - the room shouldn't matter as much - it should be just a place where you rest and shower. The buffet was pretty good contrary to most of the reviews I read on here - food was delicious and edible, especially the deserts! Pho has not bad food either - $30 for two people is very good. Mystere is a fantasic Cirque du Soliel performance and is a must see if you plan on staying at the TI. The pool is very small but refreshing especially on scorching days. Check in was very easy for us since we were fifth in line - and it seemed like there was enough staff running the desk. We checked out really fast as well - there was quite a bit of staff that day. We would be okay waiting for an hour for check in - it's Vegas - everyone from all over the world is coming at the same time as you are! Most of the staff was courteous and pleasant - a few of them were having a bad or long day - and I can understand why - dealing with humans on a daily basis who are sometimes rude or stupid can get old fairly fast. <br/><br/>Overall we enjoyed our stay at the TI. I'm not going to start with the resort fees as it seems like every hotel on the Strip charges them. We will come again as well as stay at the other hotels on the Strip.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

This trip I also stayed at the Luxor, and it didn't even come close. The amenities in the rooms of Treasure Island (an older hotel) were far superior to the newer and supposedly more modern Luxor. From the lobby to the pool deck, everything was well maintained and the staff we encountered were pleasant and helpful. Like all Vegas hotels, check-in is still a headache, there has to be a better way than standing in line like a popular ride at a theme park. This was the first time I had ever used Expedia to book the hotel there. We were treated no differently than in my visits there in the past. We had two rooms, and although I was a little concerned because I hadn't been back in a number of years, both were up to my expectations.	4	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

Hard to miss, as this was a non-smoking floor.<br/>We entered the room and saw:<br/>- popcorn on the floor<br/>- clothing tags, food, etc around the room on the carpet<br/>- towels not folded in bathroom<br/>- sheets put over the bed, but not tucked in or straightened<br/>- a smell that we found was old cheese and meat left in the fridge from the last guest<br/>- broken glass pieces on the carpet<br/>- only two pillows on the king size bed (none in the closet)<br/>- no cushions on the couch<br/>- the television did not work<br/><br/>We thought an honest mistake had been made and we were placed in a room that had not been cleaned yet. I walked down the hall and asked one of the cleaners if they had been in our room. She said that our room HAD been cleaned. So I asked if it was her. She said, &quot;Oh, there are so many girls....&quot;<br/>I called the front desk to tell them about the condition of the room. About an hour later the housekeeping manager arrived at the door with the same lady who claimed to have not cleaned our room and we pointed everything out. She had the same cleaner do the entire room over, but when she left, the cleaner &quot;forgot&quot; about half of the items on the list in a hurry to leave. We asked the manager about the pillows on the bed and couch and she told us every room only got 2. We went next door to our friends suite and found that this too, was a flat out lie.<br/>This was not only the case the first day, but every morning after....and NOT the same cleaner. On our last day we returned to the room and I cut my foot on broken glass, which we found scattered around the room. We did not break a glass. Obviously the cleaner did and did not clean it up.<br/>Despite this, we left these people a good tip every morning and still received this brutal service.<br/>The hotel decided to offer us a $8 bottle of brute to make up for 4 brutal nights in a pre-paid SUITE.<br/>Considering the choices of strip hotels out there, make this hotel you last choice unless you like to sleep, bathe and walk in other guests filth.<br/>It was so unbelievable that I kept expecting a camera crew to jump out and say we were on a tv show.<br/>On the plus side, the spa was great....I would book there but stay and gamble somewhere else.	1	5	-1	1	1	2	-1	2

I pre-paid for both rooms and we checked in Sat afternoon never once being told of a resort fee. I have to admit that the room was clean, the facilities close, the restaurants good and the location right on the strip great. The one thing that really BUGGED me was the resort fee of $28.00 a night. Nobody made me aware of this fee and I only found out when checking out! The front desk was helpful but blamed Expedia for not making it clear a resort fee would be charged even if you never used any facilities. Lucky for us it was only charged to 1 of our 2 rooms, possibly because I booked both rooms together. This is why TI gets an average rating! Get rid of the resort fee and it would of been higher.	1	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

The room was awesume and was a great start to a great trip! Thank You!<br/><br/>Room:<br/> Loved the room. We had two windows floor to ceiling showing off the Las Vegas Strip. At night looking out the one window we could watch the Sirens show below and see the fireworks exploding right outside. Very cool as long as you were not early to bed. The housekeeping was great and the room was always put together on our return. One other note, I could not believe how fast the bell hop brought our luggage to our room. We had the luggage in storage due to our early arrival.<br/><br/>Food:<br/> We ate lunch at the Senor Frogs which was good. I had a chicken taco salad that was just huge! We also went for drinks and snacks at Khahunaville bar. Lots of fun, great bartenders and food. We ordered a sampler that came out as this outrageous tray of stuff. Complete with a Volcano smoking away. The only downside to the food here is that nothing is cheap. Be prepared to pay at least double of what you think is reasonable. I was going to grab a couple sandwiches from Canters deli but couldn't get myself to blow over $30 for deli sandwiches. Cheaper food options can be found at the casinos on Freemont Street. We had a rib dinner for 2 for like $22 at Four Queens and it was great! What ever happened to cheap eats on the strip? <br/><br/>Casino<br/> The casino was nice, good size. It was smokier than I would have liked. Probably one of the more smokier casino's I visited. Drink service was above average. Nothing bugs me more than not getting prompt drink service while in Vegas. While we were there they were doing some construction inside the casino that made quite a racket that we left. <br/><br/> Overall we had a great time and absolutely loved the room. The things that prevent me from giving 5 stars would be the following. The resort fee which added over a hundred bucks to our room for 4 nights. I do not understand this resort fee. They try to justify the value of a resort fee by giving you things like free internet(most hotels I go give this free anyway), newspaper that you have to pick up yourself(oh boy),Fitness pass(like I want to work out on vacation) and a bunch of 2 for 1 things for drinks and buffet. Why not give two free drinks, free buffets? I tried the buffet for breakfast using 2 for 1 and was not overly impressed. Thats another review.	3	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

They had really good room deals available through their website. The rooms were large and fairly clean (we did find a sock that didnt belong to us). The bathrooms were large and the water pressure was really good even on the 29th floor. Ask for a room with a strip view- its amazing The buffet was okay but there was not a lot of difference between the lunch and dinner options except the prices. Also, the food is the same day after day. The casino slots are tight- dont expect to be able to play for long- we had our best luck on dollar slots. If you are looking to get comps be sure to use your players card and rack up the points and be sure to charge EVERYTHING to the room they will be able to comp a lot of it back to you if you play enough. There is a resort fee so be prepared for that- but if you book through the Casino Players Club there resort fee is dropped (however you will then need to pay $17.99/day for internet if you want it and extra to access to the gym). The free Sirens show is entertaining but slighlty inappropriate if you have kids (but bringing kids to vegas is inappropriate on your part so deal with the smut!) Lastly the pool area is large with a lot of chairs but the pool itself gets very crowded and the concrete is HOT so wear your flip flops to the edge of the pool- and expect to be splashed by the kids! We will probably not stay here again soley because it doesn't have any &quot;partner&quot; casinos so you either spend all your money there or you don't earn enough to get comps.	4	4	-1	4	3	4	-1	4

Overall, it was a nice experience. The line for check in was about 100 people long (at 3pm) but the staff worked as quickly as possible to get everyone checked in. I suggest checking in at about noon when there really isn't any lines. We stayed on the 29th floor which was nice and we had a nice view of Sirens Cove where the nightly free show is held. The only problem was that at the four show times (especially the 11:30pm show) I was woke up by canon shots. The show was a little loud, but the show was only at four different times so only the late one was a bother. Everyone was super nice and very accommodating. The room was nice and the house keeping staff was very good about bringing extra towels when needed. I never used the pool, but it looked nice and clean. I also suggest taking the free tram from Treasure Island to the Mirage to save some time. I also Don't recommend the buffet. It is ok if you aren't wanting a huge smorgasbord, but the buffet is small with little selection. The only nice things about the buffet is the hamburger/hotdog bar. Overall, it was a nice place and I would stay again if I go back.	4	3	-1	4	4	4	-1	3

We chose Treasure Island because it had a good location( across from Walgreens and the Venetian). The hotel itself was okay with a cartoonish pirate theme. Kind of tacky, but for the price, suitable. My biggest disappointment was that we were unable to lounge by the pool in the hot July weather because it was packed elbow to elbow with trashy people partying. It was like Girls gone wild!!! I felt very sorry for the people with kids. The water in the pool was soo disgusting we did not step foot in it. On the last day I complained, management did not seem to care. Finally, after complaining numerous time the manager &quot;Kenny&quot; agreed to refund my resort fees and we switched to the Paris Paris and were able to enjoy a day at the pool. If you are a single and looking for a party - this is your place!! If you are a couple looking for a nice balance of rest and relaxation- avoid this place like the plague. The clientele at the Venetian, Wynn, Bellagio, and Caesars were much more classy as were the amenities.	2	4	-1	3	3	2	-1	3

Being the middle of summer, I expect a rooms aircon to work well and cool the room but that wasn't the case in our room. We were not able to connect to the Internet at all on our stay, and when you consider the compulsory resort fee is one of the most expensive on the strip, it had better work, but it didn't.

The smell when you first walk in, the food choices, the amazing beds, and the customer service were all amazing. Then you add in the value and it was an easy choice to stay at TI during our two- three times a year trips. This last stay however was sprinkled with bad experiences that I am not sure if we could look past. <br/><br/>We were invited by the Casino host to stay for a great rate with an optional resort fee. We opted out of the resort fee at check-in and were upgraded to a beautiful south strip view room after we gave the check-in staff a $20 &quot;sandwich.&quot; One of the reasons that we love this place is because of the heavenly beds, but on the first night, we had a mattress that was so badly slanted to the edge that I barely slept. I called the front desk and they switched out the bed for a lesser slanted bed the next day. We had never had a complaint with the mattress before and this was a shock to us. The next day I realized that the hotel had put a nearly $1500 hold on my credit card. They explained the $100 per night fee, which I was aware of, but they also put in our room and tax fee. This was not explained to me ahead of time and I asked that they put at least some of it back on my card because they had not been forthright with their charges when I booked, with the offer that they sent me or upon check-in. She said that it would be back on my card in 2-3 days. 3 days later I checked my card and phoned the front desk and nothing was put through. That is a great way to make your customer feel like his or her business is appreciated! <br/><br/>Upon check out, I wanted to make sure that the two days of internet that we used were on our bill. The lady at the desk looked confused because we had apparently opted for the resort fee when we checked in! I clearly remember telling our check-in lady that we were opting out because we do not use the amenities that are offered in the resort fee. I wonder how many people have been tricked into paying the resort fee, by not confirming charges upon check out? <br/><br/>The positives were that our room was consistently clean and it was quiet during the night. We ate at Kahunaville, the buffet , Canter's and Senior Frogs, which were all good. We like that we don't have to walk a mile to get to the strip.<br/><br/>All-in-all, an ok trip, but there were too many small things to have to fight with during the stay. I think we need a &quot;break&quot; from TI. I honestly think that the value is good, but customer service is lacking.	5	5	-1	5	5	2	-1	4

Checked in with no problems, got our rooms on the 18th floor and were welcomed by dirty stained carpets, a sink that wouldn't drain and a clogged drain in the bathtub. Tolerated those issues until our third night when I woke up with bug bites on my foot and hand. Hotel staff were advised, came up to the room, gave a quick look at the bed and denied any bed bug issue, implying that I had sensitive skin and it was the strong detergents they use. Staff knocked 3 days of Resort Fees off and switched rooms for us. We didn't have any further issues.<br/><br/>Overall, the location is good, but the price we paid for the room we expected a much higher standard that which we received. <br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this hotel. Highly disappointed.	1	4	-1	2	1	3	-1	-1

We found the price to be too good to be true and booked on-line. Check-in was good, but we booked 2 rooms and was only given one resort package (2 for one, discounts). This was later corrected during our stay. At check in we found the rooms clean, not perfect. One morning, our room was not made up and we needed to get clean towels for our bathroom.<br/>Nice security at the room elevators every evening to make sure only guests were going to and from rooms. Restaurants were good, but I will review them separately. All the casinos on the strip provide free parking and the TI garage is very close to the facility so it wasn't a chore to get from the parking area to the casino and guest rooms. <br/>Pool opens early, but closes early, sometimes at 5PM. Having rooms on the 31st floor, we could still hear the loud music and parties being held during the day, so we were happy they did close the pool early.<br/>The &quot;Sirens&quot; show at night was always crowded and difficult to see. As a guest of the casino, we were given a VIP location, but this still had poor visibility.<br/>All in all, we were satisfied with the stay and comfort of the rooms. I will stay again in the future.	5	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

The rooms are more than adequet and the bed was fairly comfortable. The rooms are the best part of this facility.<br/><br/>Getting into the lobby can be a challenge in itself. Like most hotels, it's very crowded at the entry. The check-in area can get very crowded at times as it seems people arrive in bunches. Unfortunately, you don't just walk to the elevators close by, you are forced to walk through part of the casino, down a somewhat narrow walkway, considering it carrys guest and gambling foot traffic. At many times this became overcrowded, especially with luggage in tow.<br/><br/>The smell of the casino area was of a chemical/perfume trying to overpower cigarette smoke. The smell is everywhere on the main floor and carries through to the common areas on the hotel floors. Some may find this irritating. I did not notice this aroma in other casinos I visited.<br/><br/>The restaurants in Treasure Island were adequet, but nothing to write home about. Gilley's offered slightly above average barbecue and the service was good. The pizza place (Francescos) almost had a fit when asked to bake a pizza (for slices) that was advertised, but not put out for consumption. Kahunaville had a good breakfast. The two servers we had were exceptional. The hostess literally tossed our menus and silverware on the table and kept walking. Thanks to the servers for turning that bad experience into a good one. The Buffet (that's its name) was marginal. I do not recommend it for any meal. The flavor was below average, even for a buffet. Quality was questionable. Temperature was not hot. Only selection was good, but compared to other casinos, even this was not good.<br/><br/>Treasure Island is on the north side of the strip. For non-gamblers, it's accross the street from the fashion mall (enclosed and air-conditioned) which is accessible from a walkway over the road. It's also close to the Wynn, Venetian and other newer hotels. Unfortunately it's accross The Strip from the monorail. This is important is you're going to the convention center, as it's the most convenient way to get there. The monorail also stops at multiple hotels. Given the summer temperatures, saving some outdoor walking to get to the monorail may be worth the higher price of hotels on the east side of The Strip.<br/><br/>In general, the hotel was decent and affordable. Given the amenities of newer hotels and the attractions they have, you may want to stay elsewhere. But, for those on a budget, this isn't a bad choice if you have to be on The Strip.	4	3	-1	3	3	3	-1	4

The suite has a shallow foyer w/ french door style entry; until 3am we didn't realize the large gap between the floor and bottom of the door. <br/>You hear ALL and any noise from the hallway clearly. General noise of ppl going to their rooms isn't a big deal at all, but the many groups of 20 somethings who only know one voice level(yelling) becomes quite the issue at 3am. <br/>Aside from the noise I found the staff to be mediocre. The players club desk was just short of rude, dealers were ok, and bar tenders &amp; sports book were along the same route. The staff at Pho restaurant was excellent. <br/><br/>We checked out the next day and went to Paris to finish the trip; 100% better experience all the way around. <br/><br/>If you're into the club crowd then this probably isn't a bad spot for you. I think TI is achieving what they aimed to do - capture the crowd that's looking to be close to the clubs @ Mirage, etc. It's just not my crowd and top that on the cleanliness &amp; service points and I wouldn't stay here again.	3	4	-1	2	2	3	-1	2

Initially wanted to stay at Mandalay Bay but relatives were looking for a budget friendly option. I was hesitant at first but in the end our overall experience was nice. Rooms were comfortable and updated, I was on the 30th floor away from elevators and ice machine so it was very quiet. Some family was on the 14th floor so all the noise from the show disturbed a few of the younger kids while sleeping. Air conditioning is ice cold in rooms, had to shut ours off. The hallways are like an ice machine so cold air made the room comfortable. There are ice machines and vending machines on every floor. Pool was very nice and always found lounge chairs available, towels at pool were always available too. Check in line was long however, they work fast and line moved quickly. Check out went smooth as well. Booked thru expedia so be aware that there is a resort fee ($25 per day plus taxes) that they will charge you upon check in. This is not included in the expedia price ok. Denny's nearby for breakfast and the Fashion Mall Food Court opens at 9am. There is an escalator from hotel (opposite pool) that takes you to ramp to head to mall for easy access. The cirque de soleil mystere show was awesome, we really enjoyed it. I bought front row seats but honestly the theatre isn't large so even if you buy the less expensive seats you will still have a great view. The beds at the hotel were very very comfortable. I actually need to find out the name of mattress because I would like to buy it now ha-ha! Maid service was great, always available, always cleaning. You have a safe and a frig in room. There is a walgreens across the way so you can stock up on water etc there. Prices reasonable and it's huge so if you forget something head to walgreens! Souvenirs much cheaper there too. Fyi, starbucks inside hotel has tables to sit, if you go to the starbucks outside of hotel there is no sitting area. All within walking distance at this hotel so you can't beat the price. Bell transportation was great, right outside hotel. Also, for the treasure island pirate show, show your room key to security to gain access to VIP viewing outside as opposed to being with the large crowd. You will be more comfortable there and still have a pretty ok view. The mexican restaurant at the hotel (Isla) was pretty good and they treated our group great. Drinks were awesome too! The venetian does a couple of free shows as do other hotels so don't miss it. I wasn't crazy about the gondola ride, it was just ok. Family wanted to do that so I had no choice lol. I also wasn't crazy about their picture quality. If you buy the picture ($21) and frame ($25) have them place picture in the frame because you will be back the following day asking them to do this when you find you can't get it right ha-ha! I had to track back with family who bought it, was glad I did not. My daughter fell in love with the Venetian (across the street) so although I found Treasure Island fine and have no complaints when I go back we will try the Venetian. If you are on a budget and looking for a decent hotel with comfy beds and near everything then this is the place for you. Honestly you cannot go wrong. I'm what my family calls a &quot;Diva&quot; ha-ha and seriously I really have no complaints. It was a clean and nice hotel. Oh also, at night security will ask for your room keys before giving you access to elevators. I found that great in todays world you never know!	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

Check-in was very slow and my husband had to be on the long long waiting line, while I went to eat something at the coffee shop. Anyways, with our checkin we receive two coupons for free buffets and one half price which was great and really usefull. The room was good, the bed was excellent and provided great rest after the long days of walking and walking on the sun. Food was also good but expensive.<br/>The best about TI I'll say is the location. The Fashion Show Mall is at a walking distance from the hotel and there is a bridge that connects them. Also, the bus station is outside the mall so you have to go there to take the bus to the strip. The check out was made in seconds through our room TV. We had a wonderful vacation and were not dissappointed with the hotel. I would stay again at TI although I would like to try a better hotel next time, even if we have to invest a little bit more on it.	5	5	-1	5	4	3	-1	5

They're check-in process is horrible. I timed it. It took a woman and two kids 8 minutes to check in. It took me 5 minutes. There were two people behind the counter at 9 p.m. on Saturday 7/28/12. The receptionist started by saying &quot;ID and credit card please.&quot; I said, &quot;How about we start with my reservation number.&quot; His reply &quot;I need your ID and credit card.&quot; After arriving an hour late from a delayed flight, I wanted to get argumentative but decided to just go through the process. The room was fine. The casino was average. The pool was cloudy. You should do your own Google search on what is in Vegas pool water. If you don't know about the resort fee of $25+$3 tax per day you're an idiot. It's been written on TripAdvisor multiple times and it is clearly plastered all over their website. I met someone at the pool who was surprised. Really?. You didn't do a search on TI before signing up? OK then if you don't understand the meaning of caveat emptor then maybe you ought to stop surfing for sports and porn. Really. You get what you pay for generally. I paid less than Bellagio, Mirage and Cosmopolitan and got less. I'm OK with that. In Vegas I think I did OK. <br/>I like the location (walk across the street to the Walgreen's and stock up on snacks and drinks.) My room had an empty refrigerator which was perfect for keeping apples and drinks cold. This is the only hotel that I know that has a country western bar in the hotel. I understand that it is packed when the rodeo is in town. I ate at the buffet it was OK, better because it was comped. Not worth $20 if I had to pay. But then again I don't like sidling up to a trough to eat as much as I can. I'd rather pay $9 for two eggs, toast and some juice. Done.<br/>More families here than at the Mirage, Bellagio and Cosmopolitan. Basically this is a middle class hotel. Would I go back. Yes.<br/>p.s. I saw no bedbugs and didn't bring anything back. I never hurts to check the mattress and headboard though.	4	3	-1	4	4	3	-1	5

VIP check in was fast and friendly. We got a strip view room with no extra charge and had a great view of Palazzo as well as the strip.<br/><br/>We mostly played slots and always find it hard to leave due to the friendly cocktail waitresses and relatively loose slots. My wife mostly played the new Sex in the City machine while I played the Godzilla game. On our last night we were craving pizza, we asked the bell desk if they knew of any delivery options but they seemed a little clueless. I had to use an application on my phone to find a papa johns that delivered to Treasure Island. We have stayed at other strip hotels in the past and they usually have a concierge that can help you with anything you need. All in all we had a great stay and will definitely be visiting again. Always remember to visit the players club, get a club card and always use it when playing slots. If you are playing table games show the club card to the dealer so they can track your play in order to giver you comps.<br/><br/>Also remember to always tip those that help you, from the cocktail waitresses to the valet personnel.	5	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

I have always avoided TI for fear of a tacky pirate themed experience, but our most recent visit here showed me something completely different. We were in town for a convention and decided to change up our plans and stay somewhere we haven't tried before - TI. We arrived on a Monday evening and were promptly checked in and provided a room. The front desk clerk was peppy and delightful and very helpful. I believe we were upgraded from our original booking reservation as well. <br/><br/>What I particularly enjoyed about TI over some of the other resorts is that the walk to the elevators and from the elevators to our room was not an obnoxious hike that took forever. The layout of the casino/hotel and the hotel rooms is extremely convenient and there isn't a ridiculous amount of navigation involved to get around. The room was immaculate and the bed and bedding were very comfortable. So many times lately, at other resorts, little things were either not working or falling apart - light fixtures, plugs, furniture, etc. TI showed none of that. Restaurant and bar options are great and they have since opened a Senor Frogs. <br/><br/>I was a little concerned that being on the west side of LV Blvd and further north on The Strip would make us feel a little isolated, but we had no trouble getting around and keeping ourselves entertained. The walk to the monorail stop at Harrah's wasn't too difficult, just finding the monorail after walking INTO Harrah's become a little challenging. There is also a nice little tram that goes between The Mirage and TI so your walk is minimized if you want to go play, eat, or sightsee over there as well.<br/><br/>Overall, a very delightful experience and the TI is certainly a resort I will consider staying at again on future trips to Las Vegas.	4	4	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

Not the best, but certainly far from bad. I went for a short girls vacation with my friends and the hotel suited us nicely. The pool was open and was fairly nice. Got a little crowded and was a bit &quot;clubby&quot; but good overall. The poolside wait service was good as well. The hotel has a casino but its pretty outdated. Didn't end up trying any of the food options, as we always went out. Room overlooked the strip and was pretty sweet. Window looked right down on the Pirate Ship - could see/hear the mock battles that go on, but we didn't find this bothersome. Room, bathroom, beds good overall but we had some issues with water quality - it was a little hard compared to up in the Northeast and bad hair days ensued. But good experience overall. I'd stay here again. If you're looking for something a little more lively or a bit more grandiose, I'd stay somewhere else.	4	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	3

Upon entering Treasure Island you get the feel and smell of an old hotel-casino. The room we stayed in looked like it was once nice, but there was dust on everything and you could tell the room was not cleaned well. The staff was nice is about all I can say positive. The casino was the worst I have ever experienced. The slots are worse than Indian casinos and you don't even have a sporting chance to win anything or play very long. While I was playing my ticket would not work and I noticed nobody else's tickets were working. Their computer system went down and everyone had to get in line to cash there tickets at the cage which only had 2 people working. I asked how often this happens and mentioned that this was unacceptable and the cashier didn't seem to care much and didn't seem surprised about the incident, so it must happen a lot. Also there were quite a few slots that were down for maintenance. It was rediculous. We will never stay there again or even accept a free stay again. My recommendation is to avoid TI entirely. The Aria is much nicer and moved over there for the remainder of our trip.	2	3	-1	2	2	3	-1	2

I came here looking for answers and the one that i settled on was TI. My husband and I went with our friends who stayed at TI too. First off the hotel is located on the north end of the strip. You are by the Wynn, Encore, the Palazzo and Venetian. You are a little ways from stuff.. We spent most of our time down by Bill's Gambling Hall and everything else. Check-in was easy but there was a little wait, we checked in at 7:30 pm. You have to walk through the casino to get to the elevator to get to the room, which i thought was a little weird. The room was ok, nothing special and our view wasn't amazing; we were on the 8th floor. The bed was comfy, bathroom and room was clean and no weird smells. When you check in you usually get coupons for food in the hotel. There is Kahunaville: ok food not the best service and not bad prices, very large cocktail for $25 but worth it, Senor Frogs: expensive but good, Gilley's: awesome drink specials, didnt eat the food, Buffet: eh even for 2 for 1 i wouldnt eat there again, food was cold and just all around not good. In the casino you can get a players card where you win free slot play, some of the hotels do that but not all of them. There is also a starbucks inside and outside the hotel, the one outside for some reason is cheaper and has good breakfast sandwiches. There is also a margarita bar outside the hotel which is amazing! The pool was nice but there were a lot of kids like 4-8 year olds in while we were there, horsing around and the parents not paying attention, that got annoying but we dealt with it. We didnt get poolside service so cant help you there. They play music outside so no need for the Ipod unless you wanna listen to something other than popular music, the ranged from rap, rock and pop. The bell desk was very helpful! they gave us a wheelchair when my husband hurt his foot and i had to push him around (not fun! we are mid 20's, and he had tendonitis in it so that ruined some of our time) but the wheelchair was at no cost to us as long as we gave it back! We got around town mainly by walking but then we used the Deuce bus which is $2 for one way, $5 for 2 hours or $7 for 24 hours. they take you all up and down the strip. Now from getting to and from the airport we took the shuttle, it has multiple stops but is only $7 one way or $14 round trip, i thought this was the best way. Although we did take a taxi back to the airport and that was about $20. Take the shuttles when you can bc the drivers take you around the city to get more money..There was a $25 a day resort fee which includes the pool use, fitness room use and other stuff. There is a spa in the hotel but is very expensive! $300 for a couples massage, i didnt do it but i looked into it! Cirque Du Soliel was in out hotel it was the Mystere show, amazing!! We sat through a timeshare and got discounted tickets at $50 a seat and sat 4 rows from the front, we got to pick from what was available. All in all it was a great experience but next time we wills stay in the middle of the strip next time since thats where we spent a lot of time.	3	3	-1	3	5	4	-1	4

Good location, fast elevators, rooms were blandly nice. They don't seem to be doing the pirate theme to any extent. <br/>Starbucks in the lobby with regular Starbucks food! Was a nice treat. Starbucks is my go to when traveling, and too often, it's just a kiosk without baked goods, oatmeal or yogurt. This place has it all. <br/>The resort fee is annoying. Like other posters have mentioned, it's well known - you should not be surprised. Yet it is still insulting. I do prefer to stay at one of the Caesar's properties without the fee. <br/>The pool was disappointing. It was absolutely full of gross people sloshing drinks all over themselves and others. The water was so cloudy that I didn't even consider getting in. that was before someone vomited in the pool and they had to close it down. I think it may be worth paying to get into a premium pool.	3	4	-1	4	4	3	-1	4

Our first in many years, so we booked our trip on a recommendation from a family member and pictures online as well as Trip Advisor reviews. First let me begin by saying I'm kind of a hotel snob, and all in all, this was a very good room, it was very large and tastefully decorated. We booked a Petite Suite, we asked for a room with a view of the strip on a higher floor. Our view was amazing and we loved most everything about our room. The bed was super comfortable and my husband and I loved having two bathrooms in the suite. Our flight arrived in town very early and we were able to check in before 9:00 local time.....very nice! <br/><br/>When we arrived we noticed that there was no refrigerator in the room. So when I called down to ask about it, they said it was in the closet. I looked, no fridge.....they said look in the other closet...nope still no fridge. They kind of sounded like they didn't believe me, but said they would send one up. It wasn't until the following morning we realized that although it was running....nothing in it was cold ( including the insulin we needed to keep cold ) so when we called down to tell them they sounded like they didn't believe us. They said they would send someone up, about 20 minutes later this man came up to the room, looked at the fridge and said, hmmmmm nope, not working, I'll bring you another. Thanks goodness the insulin didn't go bad, or we would have had bigger problems. <br/><br/>We did not use the pool at all, as it was over 100 degrees the whole time we were there. It's in a good location, with a Walgreen's across the street as well as some of the hotels in walking distance are the Venetian and Pallazzo across the street...the Mirage was next door and the Wynn and Encore were within walking distance as well. All lovely hotels with much better casinos. <br/><br/>We toyed with the idea of taking the bus or monorail to the other end of the strip, but decided to take a cab. Be forwarned that if you take a cab, always tell the driver to stay off the strip when they take you to either end of the strip or the airport. The meter continues running even if sitting in traffic, and if you are on the strip...you WILL be sitting in traffic....we took a cab to the Bellagio and it costs us 40.00 round trip, most of the time just sitting still... All in all.....taking a cab is like Mr. Toad's wild ride......you have no idea where you will end up or heaven forbid, how much it will cost, it is definitely like putting your life in a strangers hand....and it's not a good one :( <br/><br/>We saw the Cirque du Soleil show Mystere' and it was amazing, worth every cent......we loved everyting about it. <br/><br/>Side note.....there is a ticket place called tix 4 tonight, to me it sounded a little shady, but decided to check it out for the Blue Man Group show. We went to the location by the fashion mall, you buy discounted tickets for the seating area you want to sit in.....section A, B or C....at quite a price discount. Then we immediately went across to the ticket office where Blue Man Group performs and selected our seats with the voucher we just got from tix 4 tonight. It was so nice, saved us a ton of money ( LOVED BLUE MAN GROUP!!!!!!) We actually went back the following day and bought tickets for the Seafood Buffet at the Rio ( so worth the money of you love seafood )<br/><br/>All in all, our trip was wonderful, a few miscommunication cues on the hotel end, but we were there to enjoy time together, gamble a bit, have some good meals, and see a couple of good shows.....<br/><br/>I would probably not stay there again, as I would like to try a different hotel next time, but would not hesitate to recommend it at all.	4	4	-1	5	3	2	-1	5

The rooms and decor are beautiful. There are more kids than ever before. The pool closes at and unreasonable 8pm even when the temp is well over 100F. The calypso music and party atmosphere at the pool have been replaced by family scene. The breakfast buffet has improved significantly. Good place for families. Great summer rates.	4	4	-1	5	5	3	-1	-1

I would recommend Caesar's Palace and the restaurants connected with the Venetian for quality food. Skip the buffet and restaurant at Treasure Island, however. The rooms were dated in decor and borderline in cleanliness. I was most disappointed with the pool. Loud rap music and full of highly inebriated young twenty set.	3	2	-1	4	1	2	-1	2

I was surprised of the conditions given the price of the room (relative to other hotels on the strip). My room was large, clean, and well-maintained. I saw the other rooms where my friends stayed and the conditions were consistent. The biggest plus of the room is that the air conditioner wasn't overly loud and it could be set low enough to create a chill in the air even when the outdoor temperature was 110.<br/><br/>The rest of the hotel was fine too. The buffet was so-so, but they gave me a free buffet voucher. Parking was very good. It's not too far and I didn't have to hike miles and miles to get to the elevators. The pool and fitness center are nice, but the hours are too short. For a resort hotel un summer, I was expecting both to be available until 11:00pm. Instead, they closed at 8:00 and 7:00 respectively.<br/><br/>The hotel's location is very good. Across the Las Vegas Blvd is a Walgreens and the Venetian for your shopping needs. The Fashion Show Mall with 200 shops is across the other street. The hotel has a well-stocked gift shop too. The bus stop for the southbound Deuce is located only steps away and the northbound stop is at the base of the pedestrian overcrossing connecting the TI to the Venetian. Above all else, the parking structure has excellent access to the I-15 freeway.	5	4	-1	4	5	4	-1	4

It's in a great place on the Strip, easy to get to other hotels (take the tram to the Mirage to save time and keep out of the sun). The price is great for the quality of them rooms - they may not be as fancy as some of the more expensive hotels, but they are clean, comfortable, and spacious. I don't really care for the restaurants in TI, but it's Vegas, so there are plenty of other choices. The casino is pretty and cocktail service is good. The Siren show is pretty hokey but it's worth watching if only for the spectacle.	5	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	5

Make sure that you take the shuttle to your hotel unless it is right near the airport. We took a taxi and though it was a quick trip and a friendly driver, it was a bit of a rip. But hey it's Vegas.<br/>The TI is a pretty typical 4 Star. The Casino is probably a 3 Star, but the restaurants, bars etc make up for it. The buffet is worth the money if you have an appetite (or missed lunch).<br/>The rooms are adequate, but don't need to have a red comforter on them. Similar to hotel bedspreads, these can't be cleaned daily, so you take your chances. Once again, it's Vegas.<br/>The location is very nice. Across from the Fashion Show Mall and also across from Walgreens and the Palazzo and Venetian shops.<br/>The pool is a bit small when 100 people are in it, but there are plenty of sunbeds and the servers are quite fetching in their red bikinis.<br/>The evening performances of Sirens outside are a bit cheesy, but hey it's free!!!<br/>It is only a short walk down to the Mirage and Bellagio for their free outdoor shows too.<br/><br/>A nice hotel that will have us returning later this month.	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

The first two visits there was a normal 10 - 15 minute check in time. This visit had us waiting in a line for more than an hour. I have to admit, I have never had that long a wait anywhere else ever. It was down hill from there. We have a tradition of taking our children to Vegas for their 21st birthdays. This was our youngest child's 21st bday celebration. We booked three strip view rooms, but were really disappointed, as the views weren't the best, the rooms seemed smaller and they were not as clean as our previous stays. There were a few other things that were definitely different and there was a noticeable difference in the attitude of the staff. We later learned that there was a change in management since our previous stays. I wish we had learned of this prior to booking our three rooms at TI. We had really enjoyed our previous stays, but this one wasn't the experience we had hoped for and unfortunately our daughter only turns 21 once. Wish we could turn back the hands of tome and have booked our rooms elsewhere.	2	4	-1	1	1	1	-1	2

Huge wait at check in, got &quot;upgraded&quot; to a suite because they were out of king beds. Well the suite was near the elevators and clearly a handicapped accessible suite. The bedspread and ottoman had stains on them. The 2 bathrooms needed a paint job and the shower head sucked. The tile was old, the in room fridge was old and sad.

This place was great, good location, clean, friendly. It isn't luxurious as others I have stayed at in Las Vegas but it has benefits that those higher priced places do not have. You can get food at all times of the day at the coffee shop which has really good food, it is right near the Walgreens where you can get water and snacks at all hours and the location on the strip is great. I found check in very efficient, others had said it wasn't very good. I was really happy with TI and will stay there again.	5	5	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

But the bellman wouldnt give me my claim ticket without first giving him a tip. He told me rudly, &quot;I work for tips&quot; TWICE after I couldnt understand him the first time. Somehow I dont believe this man only works for tips. <br/><br/>Check in: normally at 3pm, they started check in at 10am. Line quickly became really long I suggest you keep an eye out when they open the check in line to get in line first.<br/><br/>Room: we stepped in our room which was clean and freezing cold. A second later (literally a second later, we hadnt even set out bags down) maintainance knocks and barges in saying someone (housekeeping) reported metal sticking out of the socket in the bathroom. I had no problem with him removing the metal but a warning he was coming up would of been nice. Some nights the a/c didnt keep room cool. ***check your sheets when you stay here. We noticed several spots of dried blood on the blanket and sheets (dont care to know where it came from). We had to call housekeeping 3 times that day for someone to finally come up after the 3rd call at 1230am. Cable would always go out and freeze, hardly watched tv becuase it was interrupted every 5 mins. Bathroom was nice, bulb in shower burned out while we stayed there and the sink handle fell off. Most of the towels we had smelled like smoke. <br/><br/>Pool: we wanted to swim at the hotel pool. we walked thru once only to find it really small and no where to sit and put a towel down. there werent enough chairs. drinks at the bar near the pool were too expensive. We never went swimming.<br/><br/>VIP area for the sirens of TI: pointless<br/><br/>Buffet at TI: very good food! <br/><br/>Check out: line was long, there was a lady taking keys if you didnt need a receipt. that was easy just handed her the keys and left.	3	4	-1	4	2	3	-1	4

The room was not clean (crud behind the dresser and scummy windowsill) and the sink was stopped up. There was only one electrical outlet unless you count the 4 inaccessible ones behind the bed. We didn't bother asking them to change the burnt out light bulbs. Maybe the next guest will. Only one out of the 4 rooms we booked had bedspreads on the beds. I couldn't look up the Spanish word for bedspread on any of my devices because I was never granted wireless access, even though it was included in the package. <br/><br/> I called the front desk to ask if we had to pay $17.50 just to check our email and they neglected to tell us we could have done it cheaper in the lobby for about 8 bucks. They told me I should go across the street to McDonald's and use their public hot spot. <br/><br/>The first eleven staff members I asked didn't know where the exercise room was, or if they even had one. The lukewarm hot tub by the pool smelled like a mixture of bleach, mineral oil and urine and there were always empty beer bottles and cocktail glasses strewn all over the deck, except after 8 o'clock when the pool and hot tub closes. Too bad if you want to relax in a hot tub after dark.<br/><br/> A six pack of beer is $42.00 and they will open them all for you, even if you want to drink them one at a time. A small sign informed us that we would have to pay an undisclosed additional charge if we wanted to sit on a small square cushion by the pool (&quot;see staff for pricing') We discovered that there was another completely unused (clean smelling) hot tub on the 3rd floor but the first 5 staff I asked couldn't tell me if there was a charge to use it. The sixth one made a call and ascertained that there was in fact a charge but still couldn't tell me how much it costs. It didn't matter because that one closed at 7 o'clock pm. <br/><br/>The breakfast buffet was about 20 bucks a head so we strolled to the parking garage to drive somewhere to find an affordable egg and a cup of coffee, but were accosted by a whole battery of salespersons trying to slick talk us and scam us for everything from inedible oysters to collagen moisturizers at $245.00 a bottle. (but for YOU only $112.00) The lady asking for donations was very sweet, but she didn't stop asking until after the seventh time when we finally bought a paper flower lei from her for 20 bucks. After that she didn't want to talk to us. The one forcefully passing out coupons very sweetly said, &quot;Just kidding&quot; after I informed her that she had already given me 5 of them. It made me laugh even harder when I found another wasted piece of paper in the desk drawer in our room that bragged about how, as their commitment to the environment, they will not provide an itemized list of charges unless it is requested. <br/><br/>Children using the escalator were repeatedly forced to view scantily clad dancers on 16 screens loudly proclaiming &quot;Hot hands? That ain't half of it cowboy!&quot; on their way to the non-functioning free tram to the Mirage. If you want to take them to McDonald's across the street they can view full color pictures of naked women on hooker business cards all over the ground by the non-functioning escalator that goes to the pedestrian bridge. However, the prostitutes actually in the hotel will probably not proposition them. <br/><br/>Gruff security guards demanded to see our room keys at various locations and when I didn't have one on me I was questioned, &quot; Well how do you expect to get into your room?&quot; I saw one guard force a small boy to go buy another soda pop (don't ask how much it cost) because he had opened it to take a sip before he entered the pool area. He told us you can only bring in food items purchased at three particular overpriced shops, but this wasn't posted. He obviously hated his job, but at least he spoke English, albeit gruffly.<br/><br/>To this day I don't know if they even have a concierge or a hotel host because I never saw one. If you like to watch Chinese television shows with Chinese subtitles then you will be well provided for, but you will have to go through a layer of pay-per-view ads every time you hit the menu button on the remote. Just for fun I asked the cleaning guy who rides a vacuum cleaner up and down the hallways how much it costs for a ride on it and he told me it was seventeen thousand dollars. I guess he didn't know the English word for &quot;ride&quot;<br/><br/>The only good thing I can say about this hotel is that most of the guests, even the completely drunken ones, will be polite to you as they share similar horror stories on the elevator. I would not stay at Treasure Island again even if they paid me to. I doubt I will ever enjoy leaving a hotel as much as I did today.	1	1	-1	1	1	1	-1	1

We view the hotel as a little marvel because it is not as massive as many of the others on the strip transcending more a feeling of intimacy. Everywhere we went on the premises we were welcomed with genuine smiles. As a result we visited most of the on-site eating and drinking places where the choice of both food and drink was excellent. Finally the rooms were very nicely appointed. Everything from rooms through corridors and restaurant were done in very good taste. We so enjoyed our stay.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

I spent a week at TI in August. The room was nice definately clean, no problems with the maid staff at all. However, check in was an entirely different store...really, only three people on the desk during a rush? And one of them designated as the &quot;high roller&quot; desk clerk, so basically two full time check in and one part time. Guest Services...well, it closes at 6 during the week, so you better be able to get their quick after your meeting, otherwise you're in the overloaded check in line. I ate at the Coffee Shop mostly, food was average and I thought slightly overpriced. Felt really sorry for the wait staff who gave great service, pasted a smile on their face, but were definately overloaded trying to serve all the tables they were assigned. Here is a case where upper management needs to do some cutting on their bonuses and go back to funding good customer service.	2	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	3

I liked the hotel and as soon as you get in you are greeted with a really nice smell! Checking in was quick and effective and even the checkout was efficient since we could do this through our tv. A couple of notes - My wife had previously been to their buffet on another visit and she had recommended it...however we were a bit disappointed with that...We expected a bit more (both of us). The pool is a basic splash pool so it wasnt ideal for an experienced swimmer, but ideal for families with younger children. The rooms were quite clean, however the maids didn't always leave us extra soap and moisturizer even when this finished. Overall we were happy with our visit, especially since the hotel is very centrally located, close to the best night clubs	4	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

But our recent stay at this place proved to be a total disappointment. Although it claims to have all the amenities that hotels at this level, reality check proved to be another way. The internet speed was slow like crawling, and I could not even open the google home page without waiting for at least 10 minutes. Using the ethernet cable did not help. I was not expecting to stream netflix or youtube, but at least I should be able to surf the internet and check emails, etc., considering TI as one of the premium hotels on the strip. Also there was a power outage in the middle of the night, and I had to go to bathroom in total darkness. Furthermore, TI claims that guests staying in the hotel can enjoy reserved spots in the show &quot;Sirens of TI&quot;, but it is completely untrue, as there was no such thing as &quot;reserved spots&quot;. All in all, TI is unworthy of its reputation.	2	4	-1	2	3	4	-1	3

We finished early in Grand Canyon, and instead of staying the night at Flagstaff, AZ we decide to continue driving to Vegas and stay the night there.<br/><br/>We booked via hotels.com, and it was a good deal (or at least we felt like it was - price for a night was around $65-$70).<br/><br/>The room was stylish, clean, and the bed was comfortable... BUT:<br/><br/>There was cigarette smell in the hall (since this hotel permits smoking), and the way from the front desk to the elevators was through part of the casino (more cigarette smell and noise).<br/><br/>They charged a resort fee of $22 or so, which the only thing that we used was the WiFi access<br/>and the parking garage is not so close.<br/><br/>If you don't care for a casino, and want a quiet cigarette free hotel, I'd recommend the Trump.	4	5	-1	4	4	3	-1	4

The only thing that lets it down is the rooms, for a 4 star hotel they are a bit basic, clean but basic. For the money its fine, although if you can afford one of the 5 star hotels go for it. The pool is quite small but had a really good atmosphere round it with a DJ there at the weekends. Try one of the Grape Ade cocktails at the pool bar they are yummy. While we were there the temperature hit 113 degrees it was too hot and we did struggle to walk in that heat. Good tip go to the town square shops for Abercrombie etc the shops were heaps cheaper than the mall next door. Fremont street is a must , so much to do in Vegas so stay a while . We didn't pay the resort fee and all we missed out on was the Wifi.	4	4	-1	3	4	3	-1	-1

The inside or the Siren show.	3	0	We got a Priceline deal for $60... Didn't include the $25 resort fee. The pool was small and filled with bikini clad girls on top of drunk guys' shoulders... Typical Vegas, not super family friendly! The casino was smoky and poorly ventilated compared to the next door Mirage. The siren show was WAY loud and crowded as could be... Not to mention too seductive for under 13, and I am by no means a prude! <br/>We did have to wait in an hour line to check in, even on a Sunday afternoon.<br/>I would suggest using the valet... They work on tips only, so $5 gets your car parked and you don't have to search for a spot and walk in the heat with your stuff!<br/>Overall, we probably wouldn't pick this hotel again.	3	4	-1	3	4	2	-1	-1

The maids didn't do a brilliant job but was ok.We didn't go to Vegas to gamble just to see the sights so I can't comment on the gaming there.There is a nightly show outside the hotel with pirates and moving ships well worth the wait to watch.Our daughters loved the pool area with music and towels to borrow,very clean and comfortable sun beds.Denny's is across the road for a cheap breakfast also walgreens which sells everything.The only drawback is the resort fee that everyone has to pay in all the hotels which is over ?73 for four nights !!	4	4	-1	4	3	4	-1	5

Near the better hotels (Wynn, Bellagio) and across the street from the Fashion Mall - three story shopping mecca with a decent food court. Free asy access, self parking available which is really nice. Short, easy drive to and from airport also. Believe it or not, this property really cares about its customers. Rooms are in continual renovation floor by floor and the hotel takes into account customer comments and reviews. In room safes were changed out to accommodate lap tops and refrigerators added. They are already changing out flat screen TV's for newer ones. No coffee makers yet as they want you out of your room and in the casino. Hotel is always running specials so check out their Facebook page for the best deals. Has a car rental agency (Dollar) located in hotel if you want to rent a car for the day. Mid-range dining options available which change every couple of years. Favorite though is Canter's deli by the Sports Book. The BEST matzo ball soup and potato pancakes in the city. (Other Canter's in other hotels aren't as good.) Two Starbucks (one in the hotel and one just outside) with a Walgreen's across the street for those forgotten items. Also within walking distance to a church for those of us on Sunday who desire so.	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

I like luxury. This is a 2-3 star in my opinion, so naturally I will not return. I would rather pay $200/ night for a really nice property than $100 /night for this place.<br/>Let me start of with all my positives. The room was nothing special but it was clean, had everything we needed. The beds were comfortable with nice linens. If you are a light sleeper you dont want to be on side facing pool as you can hear pool dj through the walls.<br/>We had to leave the hotel to do everything: gamble, eat, good food, shop, party etc. Thank goodness the hotel is well located close to some pretty nice properties. Oh! another positive: There is a Starbucks in the casino. The casino here is terrible. It really feels like a GreyHound Bus terminal. They literally had duct tape on the rugs as you walk into the casino. The tape seem to be used to tape them to the floor. Ugh!! Really nice first impression. I have been to nicer Casinos on Indian Reservations in LA and OKLA. REALLY!! We waited in line for over an hour just to check in. Every time I was in the Casino I felt like I wanted to just get out of there. The celings are low, and everything is packed in there. Including all the people. Seven ladies dressed to the nines looked very out of place walking through the casino, in fact we looked LOST! Sunday at the pool we got a cabana and being a pack of women footloose and fancy free for the weekend we made our own silly fun here all day. The cute little cocktail waitresses on red hot bikinis took great care of us and a good time was had by all. No complaints on the pool. Not fancy, but again- no big deal. Do your homework. You can get a room for less the $200/night on the strip at places like Wynn, The Hotel, Ceasars, Mirage, MGM etc- stay anywhere- dont stay here<br/>This was a girls trip to celebrate my Youngest Sister's Graduation, so regardless of our hotel choice, we had a wonderful time.<br/>One of the girls found the deal $169 for 2 nights, which after taxes and resrot fees etc ended up being $220 for 1 of our rooms. I did not get this deal and my sister and I paid $350 for 2 nights	2	5	-1	3	3	3	-1	4

The Hotel/Casino was very clean, nicely decorated and had great layout and one of the best locations on the strip. We have stayed at the TI's sister property, the Mirage and while very nice, the walk to the rooms all the way through the casino was a bad floor plan. The TI has a very nice bridge to the Fashion Show mall and an excellent setup for parking. Rooms were nice, spacious with great bedding. The staff was super helpful and courteous. The Mystere show on the property was one of the best in Vegas. The only thing I would change is to offer more food court options. The coffe shoppe is too expensive for the food quality. More towels in the rooms would be the icing on the sweet cake.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Now, not so much.	2	0	My husband and I returned to TI at the beginning of August for 4 nights. We spent the same week last year and had a pretty good experience, which is why we chose to stay again this year. This year, I feel like TI has seen better days. The overall feeling of everything from the pool to the casino to the room was &quot;why bother&quot;. <br/><br/>Check in at 4:30pm on a Sunday was packed, but they moved the line pretty quickly. The $28/night resort fee gets you a bunch of stuff that should be included in the nightly price, such as internet and access to the fitness room, but it seems that the new trend in Vegas is to get people there cheaply, then tack on all of the non-optional fees once you are there and have no choice but to pay them. I didn't bring a computer and I am recovering from knee surgery, so neither of these &quot;features&quot; were of any use to me whatsoever, yet I was forced to pay for them.<br/><br/>Got up to the room, and while my husband and I are not particularly picky, there were several little things that made us realize that attention to details is not a priority. Our bed had no bed skirt. Just a ghetto box spring mattress. I mean, I even managed a bed skirt in college when my box spring was on milk crates! I then went in the bathroom to unpack my toiletries, and on the edge of the bathtub were 2 brownish rings roughly the circumference of beer bottles. Maybe the housekeepers cracked a couple brewskis while cleaning the bathroom and forgot to wipe up the rings from their overflow? Room was not vacuumed very well. Big hunks of lint, a couple of little pieces of paper. Big huge streaks on the mirror. Refrigerator pretty dirty.<br/><br/>Same for the rest of the property. There was a lamp in our hallway by the elevator that had a lamp shade that was super cock-eyed. Not just a little crooked, but almost completely sideways. Would have taken management 30 seconds to straighten it, but it remained obviously cock-eyed the whole time we were there. We also rented a cabana for the day, and it was FILTHY. Just skanky. I had to empty 2 ashtrays that were in there when we checked in. Sat them on a trash can in the pool area, and they were still sitting on the trash can when we checked out at 5pm. The birds got in to some jelly packets at the Kahunaville restaurant in the pool area, and there they stayed for the whole day, big blobs of jelly and picked-open packets baking in the sun all day. The pool clientele was also pretty trashy. Sort of the &quot;Girls Gone Wild&quot; crowd, except these poor gals didn't have very good friends, because if they did, their friends would have told them the truth about how they had no business wearing these skanky bikinis.<br/><br/>The casino itself was DEADSVILLE. No ambiance or fun energy AT ALL. Boring dealers. Couldn't even rally a little energy at a craps table! We went off-site every night because there was nothing fun or exciting about this property. We had fun at the Rhumbar at the Mirage and in the casino at Harrahs or the Flamingo. Older properties, but TONS of fun. Restaurants were mediocre and had very little selection. Nowhere we were super interested in eating. We kind of felt like we were on a crappy cruise ship.<br/><br/>Bottom line is this: there was nothing AWFUL about this place, but you can certainly do much better for little to no more money. A bunch of little overlooked details add up to a pervasive &quot;Who cares?&quot; attitude by the entire staff from the front desk to the dealers to the housekeepers to the maintenance staff to the management. Unfortunate, as this was not at all the feeling we had last year. We will not stay here again.	3	4	-1	2	2	2	-1	3

Wish they had a non-smoking area in their casino, but then again that seems to be a problem all over Vegas. Nice to have Cirque du Soleil here, the buffet was a good value for the money (especially with a discount, and arrive for lunch at the last minute and you'll be able to sample the dinner items, too). The show out front with the pirate ships is fun -- just racy enough to feel you're in Vegas, but with enough action that even kids can enjoy it.	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1

As an invited guest, we were able to choose not to avail ourselves of (and therefore not pay for) the resort fee items. The hotel is in a great location, with easy access to everything mid-strip which is where many of both the classic and new casinos are located. Unfortunately, the tram between TI and Mirage was not working the entire time we were there (five days). This made visiting that end of the strip more difficult as it was over 100 degrees every day.<br/><br/>We also experienced the power outage, which lasted four hours. This was of great concern to us as we were on the 28th floor and worried that we would have to walk down the stairs as it was taking so long to fix. As I am on the other side of 60 years old, this would have been potentially dangerous for me. Also, should one of us have had a medical emergency how in the world would paramedics reach us?? Luckily in the end all was well, but next time I am asking for a lower floor for sure!<br/><br/>We have been to this casino many times, and have stayed here many times before as well. The rooms are decent; not high end but not Motel 6 either. I will say that the TV is so small as to be ridiculous, and the channel selection minimal. Not that we were here to watch TV but sometimes after a long day we like to relax and watch some TV before bed. At my age, I could barely see it. On the plus side, there was a very nice refrigerator in the room rather than the ubiquitous mini-bar most hotels stick you with. The beds and pillows were decent, but not up to the quality of the neighboring property Mirage, where we stayed for the two days prior. All in all we were satisfied as we had been here before and knew what to expect.<br/><br/>As to the casino itself, I certainly can't say the machines were kind to us but we enjoyed it. It seems they are trending more and more to a party atmosphere and a younger crowd, which is unfortunate for us. They have added a Gilly's country and western bar and restaurant and Senor Frogs. Nothing wrong with these, but they do add alot more noise and hustle and bustle to the place. Whether this is a plus or minus for you depends on your tastes. While the crowd is trending younger, it is more of a middle class, regular folks type of casino (as opposed to a place like Cosmopolitan which was loaded with upper and upper middle class 20 somethings clearly earning a higher living than many as evidenced by the swarms of them at the $25 or higher blackjack tables). Again, whether this is a plus or minus depends on your point of view.<br/><br/>As in any major casino, the food options are many but extremely pricey. We ordered a 'medium' pizza to go one night which cost $20 before tax. (for a medium pizza?!?!) At least it tasted good. The deli is also insanely expensive, but at least it is good quality and generous portions.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a decent hotel in a great location. If that is your expectation you will not be disappointed. If you are looking for glamour or high-end, choose Wynn or Venetian across the street.	4	5	-1	3	4	5	-1	3

She booked Treasure Island as our hotel and we were very happy with our stay there. The rooms are very nice and the beds are second to none. In fact, we took a picture of the mattress tag and while we were doing our wedding planning we checked with Sealy to see where/if we could purchase one. <br/><br/>Our purpose of the trip was to get away and to the tourist/site-seeing of Vegas, so we were in the hotel room very little but to sleep and get ready. I don't recall eating there.<br/><br/>Service - great<br/>Rooms - awesome<br/>Entertainment - I didn't feel Ti offered near as much as many of the other casinos<br/>Dining - I can't rate, I don't believe we ate onsite<br/>Spa - I can't rate, we didn't use it<br/>Pool area - looked nice, but was too cold the weekend we went to go swimming. Pool area had a lot of shade, which would be nice when hot, not so much when not<br/>Gaming - OK<br/><br/>In short, if you want a quitter hotel with great beds and very nice rooms I'd recommend Treasure Island. If you're looking for a place to get wild without leaving the building, this wouldn't be my recomendation. Would I stay there again? Absolutely, but I'd probably be more interested in something further south like Paris simply due to location on the strip.	4	4	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

I've stated in Las Vegas on the strip at other hotels that were much better. The biggest disappointment was the pool... It's a little pool with an enormous amount of people in it. No way to even get into the pool to stand. The chaise lounges are right under the sun (no shade). The cabanas are $125 for the day and can fit four people... <br/>The room itself is ok. We've stayed at a suite. Clean, nice, but nothing glamorous...	3	5	-1	3	4	3	-1	-1

The hotel clerk automatically upgraded us as we checked in but it is really dissappointing to find the 25.00 service fee per night! We hardly used the ammenities that they said included the 25.00 fee. They should just add it to the room fee per night and not try to make it sound like you are getting more because of the 25.00.	3	5	-1	5	3	4	-1	5

We were here celebrating my BF Dads 70th B-Day. I picked this hotel because of the proximity of the pool, restaurants, casino and valet, you dont have to walk a million miles to get to one of these places. The rooms have the most comfortable beds, sleeping was a pleasure that you are not sleeping on a stiff board of a bed. The casino has the usual blend of games. If you are a bigger player see the casino players club you could get your meals and resort fees comped like we did........You will not be dissapointed staying here......	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Originally we had booked at the Mirage, but T.I. stole us away with a promo they offered. It was about $200 cheaper and we received a couple of extra perks as well. Although the Mirage is a bit nicer, it was hard to beat the value that this hotel provided. For a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday stay, it was only $279 with tax included. Also, with the promotion, the resort fee was optional. Obviously, we chose not to add almost an extra $120 to our rate. <br/><br/>With our package, we were able to check in under invited guests which was a lot quicker. We did notice quite a line for normal check in. We arrived about 9:30pm. I would guess the wait to be about 25-30 minutes. The young lady that checked us in was very nice, polite, and professional. <br/><br/>The room we received was nice and clean with a good view of the strip and the Mirage volcano. The only minor issue we had was a slow bathtub drain. Also, the bathrooms could use a little more lighting. There is a fridge in the room that is free to use. That was a nice touch. We were able to keep chilled water and other beverages in there. The beds were very comfortable and we slept well. There was never any noise at night.<br/><br/>The casino is not as big and action packed as others on the strip. We still have a good time there. It was nice to end our night right where we were staying. Drink service did seem a little slow. Although, it was like that just about everywhere.<br/><br/>Room for improvement is the pool area. It is very small for a hotel this size. I would hope to see an upgrade in the near future. During the weekends, it can become very crowded.<br/><br/>The buffet was decent. I think it was about $25. For an extra $5, you get a much better choice of food and options at the Bellagio. The one great thing about T.I. buffet is the service. Seriously, these people were on it. Very quick, polite, and in a good mood. We got better service here than in many other sit down places we visted. <br/><br/>Location is ok, but not great. It is toward the end of the strip with only Wynn and Encore past the hotel. You can make it to the center of the strip (Caesars Palace), in about 10-15 walk.<br/><br/>All in all it was a good trip. The big question is, would we stay here again? The answer is somewhat complicated. If we continue to get the deals that we have been from Treasure Island, most certainly. If the price goes up, we would explore other resorts.	5	3	-1	4	4	4	-1	5

Enjoyed our experience! Would definitely stay there again. Everyone was wonderful in the restaurants and front desk. Asked for a room with a view of the strip and was not disappointed.

The hotel looks a little tired in the casino area but the rooms were great. We had a great view of the strip as well. The room was neat and tidy and felt a lot fresher compared to the casino. The resort tax, although annoying (more a less very hotel has this now) gave us free buffet passes for one night, and 2 for 1 on another night which was great. The buffet here is very good with pasta cooked freshly in front of you and a wide variety of cuisines from around the world on offer.<br/>The check in queue here was big, but this is my third stay in a third hotel in Las Vegas and I've always queued when checking in, that's Vegas for you! We hired a car with Dollar and the office is in Treasure Island meaning we just walked into the car park and picked our car up.<br/>The hotel is in a good location, we got it at a great price and I would stay here again.	4	5	-1	4	4	5	-1	5

Had a very nice room on the 28th floor. Elevators were quick, room was clean and quiet, the view was perfect. We looked out directly onto the strip, with the Sirens of TI show just below our windows. We ate at Gilley's and the Coffee Shop. Coffee Shop was over priced and the quality was poor. Gilley's was very good. We also saw Mystere, which was a very good show. The casino is very good, although the drink girls can be few and far between with less than pleasant attitudes. Overall we had a very pleasant stay. Check out was seamless as well. The resort fee is optional, and expensive, so we opted out. We survived a couple of days with no internet without much trouble at all. :) The bedding at TI is superior to other hotels. Soft pillows and comfy beds!	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

I was disappointed from the start due to the employee at the &quot;invited guest check in&quot; not making me feel &quot;invited&quot; at all. I dont think the girl smiled once. She was snappy, interrupted me and provided no details as far as where our room was in the hotel. I spent over $600 for my room, and over $1000 on my wedding at the Hotel (the wedding chapel was great, completely separate review for that) and thats how I got the invited check in. I wasn't expecting royal treatment just common courtesy and a bit of customer service as far as &quot;welcome to hotel&quot; and a general idea of where my room was etc. We were only on the 14th floor which was kind of disappointing as we ordered a suite and thought we'd get a top floor room for the best view. It was pretty loud in our room due to the music at the pool. Luckily the pool closed pretty early but it was still loud being closer to the strip. The temperature control in the room was really extreme being either freezing or muggy. I arrived at about 3 pm on a sunday... my wait to check in was only about 5-10 minutes since I was in the invited check in line but the regular check in line was pretty long, most of my family stayed at TI for the wedding (they also had average experiences) and they had anywhere to a 30-50 minute wait to check in. Also don't goto Gilleys Bar inside. The music is blaring so you cannot hear anyone your with and can barely understand whats even coming out of the speakers. The bartenders talk with their friends instead of serving a party of 6 waiting to spend $$ on drinks. We ended up leaving due to not getting a drink after 15 minutes of waiting. Once a bar back did mock us waiving for the bartender to bring our drinks. We inconveniently had to leave the hotel for a different bar but were at least happy to know the bar that got our $500 tab was willing to serve us. It was an all around average experience, the rooms were clean I did get a non smoking room but for a $28 resort fee and no customer service provided even when your spending a fortune at the hotel doesn't make you want to come back. Next time I'd rather pay a little extra for a much nicer hotel that will appreciate you staying with them.	3	4	-1	4	4	1	-1	3

But check-in takes so long, you might miss the boat!	3	2	This review is a summation of several stays here over the course of 2012, with the most recent stay just this past week.<br/><br/>The casino - Overall, TI is an older-ish casino that could use some rehab in the main casino area. It's a bit dark and dank on the inside and shows signs of wear and tear, but still manages to pull off a fun vibe. Plenty of dining options, as well as Starbucks and gift shops. Casino personel seem to be generally nice and upbeat. The pool area is a bit small, but still fun when it's not too crowded. Wide variety of table games and slots to satisfy most budgets.<br/><br/>The room - I've always had a clean, comfortable room here with stylish and attractive furnishings. I always did either a standard king or 2 queen room. I wouldn't mind a slightly larger TV in the rooms, but hey not everything can be perfect.<br/><br/>My only real gripe with staying here is the check-in process. I've waited AT LEAST an hour every time I've checked in here. Twice in the late afternoon, and once around 11pm-midnight. This past weekend for example... probably around 100 people in line, with 3 hotel reps checking people in. I started timing a few of the check-ins, in one instance it took over 15 minutes for a hotel rep to check-in a group of 2 people. They seriously need to either beef up staff at peak times, or streamline the check-in process. The last thing people want to do after driving for 4-5 hours from LA or getting off a multi-hour flight is wait another 1-1.5 hours to check in to their hotel. Especially late at night! Last weekend, there was a nice lady handing water to people that were annoyed from waiting so long. Why couldn't she go behind the counter and help check people in?! After this last weekend, it's finally enough to make me not want to stay here again. There are plenty of other places I can stay at where I don't feel like just going to bed by the time I get to my room, after waiting so long to check-in.<br/><br/>Overall, not a bad place to stay, although it could do with some renovations to the main casino area. There's a new seafood place opening in the near future, it looks promising. I'm not sure if I'll stay here again, but if you don't mind a long wait at check-in, I would say go for it.	5	5	-1	5	5	4	-1	5

It has a shuttle service to the Mirage and it's a nice walk to the other hotels (Aria, Bellagio, etc). It is a great value because the average traveler only uses the hotel to sleep for a few hours at night and visit bars, clubs and restaurants in fancy hotels. It is a nice place to stay if you want to be in a good location without paying crazy amount of money in a fancy hotel. You can walk to the hot spots from there :)	5	4	-1	3	5	3	-1	5

This place could be much better!!	3	4	Its not a poor rating for this place but it needs improvement. I was debating hard on what to rank TI...Gonna call this a 2.49...I went with this low rating for a few reasons I will name later but also came up with it because I have never ever once won a nickel at the tables or on the machines at this casino! So I may be a tad prejudiced with this review!! <br/><br/>Well here goes my thoughts on this place. This place is so hit or miss!!! The line to check in ...SUCKS ..almost always takes forever unless you are on a com'd deal , then its fantastic because the players club line is almost always empty!! The pool area, just is not all that great . C+ in my book. I have always had inconsistent service here even though the waitresses outfits do help the frustration of having to wait for a cocktail. The daybeds to lay on run about $35 during the week, not bad. <br/><br/>The rooms here are nice. There really are. Mine had a frig in it, which is virtually a no-no anymore in Vegas! Well a frig where you can actually store things. <br/><br/>The casino floor stinks. I hate the layout completely. The dealers here are like robots. Just boring! I cant tell you how many times I have seen almost no one even at the tables. The siren show that starts at night is fine. Begins about every 90 minutes. The girls are beautiful and its fun to see ..ONCE(well maybe twice)...then its complete boredom. Their long running show Mystere is very good, but its time to bring in something new. I mean how many times can you see these circus shows, especially the same one? You can get really good room/show deals though if you have never seen Mystere, look on the website for TI and stay during the week! <br/><br/>The restaurants at TI are pricey and very inconsistent. Senor Frogs is not good at all while Kahunaville(coupons galore) is not bad and the party bar next door is a blast and the only night spot in this place that seems to get carried away!! Shots are flying there!! Gilleys has always been boring when we have been and the food beyond overpriced for what you get. The Breeze Bar near the entrance is hit or miss as well, but sometimes late gets really going. The coffee shop is good for breakfast but of course way overpriced. $15 for eggs bacon and coffee. Phils Steakhouse is very average for the money. Its expensive and one would think you would leave with your mouth begging for more. Not the case here. Portobella starter good, French onion soup not bad, Filet ok, crab good, lobster not cooked right, Halibut just very average...It was not bad overall but for $105 each....umm...it should be a hell of alot better! <br/><br/>This casino runs quite a few specials. LOOK for them online or make sure you are signed up for their players club! They run specials for locals often too. I would never pay up to stay at TI, but I guess if I get it for free up to $70. I would consider it for the price and location. Dont forget they whack you for an interent/gym fee. Anyway dont let one of the Sirens of TI throw you off the plank here ...or come to think of it maybe getting captured by them isnt such a bad idea and would make your rating rise to a much higher level!! ARgh!!	4	5	-1	4	4	2	-1	4

On each visit I have stayed at a different Hotels, the Bellagio, Tropicana, Planet Hollywood and The Mirage. This is not your 5* or most expensive hotel but for the money it was good choice. I dont understand the negative reviews on the casino. I had luck at the slots, actually won a progressive jackpot and my friends who are rookies did okay at the blackjack tables...you are gambling after all. Location was good. Great access to the Fashion Show mall, Walgreens and Starbucks, McD's all nearby. The rooms were comfortable, clean, comfy pillow top mattresses, mini fridge, quite hallways and great strip view. Food was okay. Did not visit the pool. Weekend pool partys did not interest me, too many people and too loud, more suitable for the 20-30 age group. I never had any issues with TI and would consider staying again. As usual, I had an awesome time in Vegas, won some money and did some great shopping and came home with some winnings!!	4	4	-1	4	5	4	-1	5

We chose to stay at Treasure Island Hotel because we purchased tickets to Cirque Du Soleil - Mystere which was awesome by the way.<br/><br/>In Vegas you cannot escape the party atmosphere no matter where you are however Treasure Island is very clean, comfortable and everything is right there. We had planned to go to a few other hotels but we stayed there the whole two nights we were there! The bed was super comfortable and I wanted to buy the pillows for my home!<br/><br/>The Players Club comp's were pretty good. I happen to win the Slot-O-Matic daily spin which gave you $250 bucks of free slot play which was a nice perk. If you stay the night at this hotel as well as gamble here, you might receive comps! We did!<br/><br/>We will try a few other places on future visits	4	3	-1	5	4	4	-1	5

We got checked in straight away without having to wait in line, and were given a room on the end of one of the points. This was our honeymoon, and the room was everything you could ask for. Large, clean, and with a view up the strip one way, down the strip the other, and overlooking the pirate ship. The bed was massive and was the best i have stayed in. <br/><br/>We tried every casino on the strip, and this was our favourite. Will be going back again next year.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Its located wonderfully at the Strip, just outside where it all happens around Bally's, Flamingo, Bellagio etc. It also means that theres less noise, which is actually rather nice, if you aren't a youngster coming to Vegas just to get drunk, haha. <br/><br/>The hotel is one of the smaller ones at the Strip, I guess .... at least the Casino is much smaller than at the other hotels, we went to .... same goes for shops/stores and restaurants. <br/>We were arriving to Vegas to get married and get upgraded to top floor, which was fantastic and had a wonderful view over the pirate-show, Venetian and over that whole part of the city. <br/><br/>A few things though. We left 5 dollars for the room cleaners one day .... got fresh towels etc. Next day we left 3 dollars .... didnt get any towels to dry our hands in. 3rd day .... left 5 dollars again and the towels were back lol. So 5 dollar tip seems to be what they expect, which coming from Europe where everything is included in the price you pay for the hotel, well I find it a bit crazy, but hey ... what do I know :) <br/><br/>Another thing ... the buffet at the restaurant. Its not really something spectacular at all .... its just food. At least my husband and I didnt find it that good. Its okay .... but heard of the sea food buffet at the Mirage I think it was .... should be fantastic .... this was not even close :) So if you are looking for a meal, its find .... a bit pricy though (if you havent got: pay 1 and get 1 for free vouchers). 30 dollars per person or something .... I find that expensive. <br/><br/>Anyway ... guess thats it. Didnt get to try out the pool area .... wanted to go there on our last day, as our plane left late in the evening .... but needed our roomcard to enter the pool area, but as we had checked out, we werent allowed entrance.<br/><br/>Over all a nice hotel, if you are there for vaca. If just staying for a night or 2, I would recommend one of the above mentioned more centralized hotels, as I think the standard of the rooms are quite good all over. We had a deluxe luxury room and had a lot of space there .... really nice room, I have to say ... although there was dust all over, when we arrived .... I wrote &quot;pig&quot; in it, hehe .... and wasnt cleaned during our stay .... <br/><br/>Ohh btw .... tried the spa on 3rd floor ..... was a reaaaalllyy nice place. REAAAALLY expensive too though, hehe .... but lovely spa place, if you are in for spoiling yourself a bit :)	4	4	-1	5	4	4	-1	5

It started with a very long check in line (half of the check in helper stations were empty) but once we did get help they were good.<br/><br/>Here comes the bad parts:<br/>1) our room was not services/ cleaned for two days.. Their excuse: we have 4000 rooms to clean.. Not acceptable and when I made arrangments for them to come in at a specific time, they never showed.. So room was not cleaned for three days. They did apologize profusely and did give me no charge resort fees for two days and a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience.<br/>2) Be very careful using their long distance. To just pickup the phone they billed me 12.00 and then they wanted to charge me a total of $53.00 for one call to BC. It felt like being in a third world country. Honestly, I may not have read the info on their phone correctly.. very hard to read what the charges will be... BE CAREFUL. Begrudgingly they did deduct $25.00 .. THANKS TI ( and this is not a sincere thanks) as it is not acceptable to be charging this type of long distance rates in the day and age.<br/>3) The cashiers at the buffet are plain RUDE.. perhaps they are overworked.. this is not an excuse for rude behavior.<br/>4) I expect their low prices/promotion attracted the younger and rowdier crowd because one group in our party had to call security two nights in a row.. and got very little sleep.<br/><br/>And the good:<br/><br/>1) the Buffet was good and it was even better on the Saturday night we attended.. Seafood selection of crab legs, stuffed crabs, clams.. and many other choices. Compliments to the head chef who actually came out and helped two in our party that suffer from Celiac.. in fact they made them both a special pizza to order. THANKS<br/><br/>2) The location is good and bad. It's great as you can get to the Fashion Show Mall via TI through a walkway that is just past Canter's Deli. It's good because you can go out and cross an pedestrian overpass to the Venetian. IT'S BAD, as it's location is close to a couple freeways that intersect and we heard so many police and ambulance sirens.. it was annoying.<br/><br/>As I said to the Front staff at checkout: I will NOT be going back to this hotel.<br/><br/>FYI, previously stayed at Paris, Luxor, Flamingo and would choose any of them above TI	3	4	-1	3	2	2	-1	2

This is my 3rd time going and Las Vegas never fails us. I am happy that I have chose Treasure Island for this trip. Everything was clean, nice, and what I have expected from watching Youtube Videos. We arrived about 5 o'clock. The check in wasn't long at all. We had another couple with us and while checking in, we asked if we can get rooms on the same floor. When I booked my tickets, I have already booked for the strip view. The couple with us didn't book a strip view, but it all worked out somehow. They have checked us in on the same floor. I have requested for 30 floors and up from reviews on TripAdvisor. I am happy that I asked. Our strip view was so beautiful! We saw the pool from above, Mirage, Venetian, Paris, ceasars palace and many more hotels. Everything was nice about the room.The bed was really comfy. I slept very good and did not hear much noise. The only thing I didn't like was the toilet did not want to flush. It was slow at going down, but we can deal with it. It's not a big deal. Plus we are barely in our rooms anyway. The TI buffet was ok, you get a 2 for 1 coupon. Kahunaville was awesome! We had dinner there, food was great, and it was good; we had coupons to use. The total minus $20.00, not bad. Plus I had leftovers to take back. Location was great! It was near walgreens, fashion Mall, starbucks, and Mcadees. It's very affordable and at the center of everything. Being near walgreens and the fashionmall is very helpful when you need something. I would consider staying here again, but next year, we are looking to stay at The Cosmopolitan. I would recommend the hotel to family and friends.	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

I had a very good view of the strip and the hotel was very nice. However, the pool was the not. The music was playing way too loud and the pool was very crowded with adults who were drinking way too much. Not good for children. Overall, it was a very good hotel.	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

I expected less since this is an old hotel compare to newer hotels on the strip. I was pleasantly surprised rooms were nice and clean. A bathroom was clean and nice. Very good location on the strip. A lot of younger travelers. I think cost of the rooms had something to do with it. I recommend this hotel.	5	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

I've been to vegas 6 times and every time we go back we check in to different hotels. the worst hotel that we''ve stayed is luxor. It's just old and weary. it needs renovation..imperial palace is a lot better than luxor. <br/><br/> TI exceeded my expectations, since maybe we checked in on a weekdays/school starting. we stayed in a deluxe room/strip view. we got a good view and a good deal too. Our room was soo clean, bed is ok, front desk was so helpful and even the cleaning lady is nice. lol..<br/><br/>so yeah, the $25 resort fee is not bad. u got to get the internet which is good and their 2 for 1 buffet pass and some % off when you next book with them. I can't say anything bad about this hotel coz i didn't experience anything. like what i always say on my previous reviews It's prolly a day to day experience.<br/><br/>lastly, we didn't go to the pool since it's always crowded and the pool is so little.. i would book here again next time.	4	5	-1	4	5	4	-1	3

I had read some people waited over 45 minutes to check in and I would believe it because there were a couple of days that I was down in the lobby and the lines were very long. The hotel room are clean and updated and the beds are comfy. Our shower wouldn't drain one morning and we called maintenance and they came and fixed the problem immediately. The pool was very overcrowded both Saturday and Sunday and we could hear the music from our room on the 17th floor it was way more calmer on Monday and Tuesday. I would stay here again!	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1

One time was because a rude couple was standing in the hallway screaming and fighting for quite some time. The other time was because the rooms on either side of us decided to have a music war in the early hours. Security was very quick to take care of the issues and I know it wasn‚Äôt the hotel‚Äôs fault that people are rude but it still left an uneasy feeling. One morning the cleaning staff was cleaning a room right across the hall and she was whistling while we were trying to sleep. It was so loud and annoying we finally got up and went next door and asked her to please keep it down. Like I said, some people are just RUDE! Other than the cleaning lady whistling the staff and service was good. In the shower there was a little mold in the caulking and one of the toilets would leak real bad and dumped water all over the floor every time we flushed.	3	3	-1	3	2	3	-1	3

Location was perfect, right on the strip!

Pool was clean lots of towels! I left one morning and forgot my diamond ring and some money on the nightstand next to the bed went back to room a few hours later, house keeping had already cleaned my room and didn't touch the ring or the money! Buffet was really good, great walk ways to the other casino's and mall! Our room was on the 27th floor and it was spotless and cold, loved it! Loved the express check out! Check out was around 11:30 am our flight was at 10pm the bell boy locked our luggage in a locker so we didnt have to carry it around and it was free! DEFINITELY staying here again!	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

Communication to guest was poor we were told it was a utility blackout or a car accident . Upon finally entering our room we had no power , ac worked no lights . The power finally came back on at 5 am , we knew due to the lights came on . The hotel never sent an appology , I spoke to the hotel manager upon check out with our concerns ( roaches , rude security ) we were offered a food credit of $25 ( no didn't except it ) . The bottom line is the casino was not effected and sutuation was mishandled , I have worked in the travel industry this is not how you get guest to return . would I return &quot; NO &quot;.

A Walgreens over the road bridge so you can get whatever you need cheaper than in the hotel. Very nice pool area. Pho restaurant on site - quite good Vietnamese food. The negatives: hidden surcharge of the infamous Resort Fee; information at Check in delivered so fast and so impersonally its hard to understand what's being said (e.g.about the Resort Fee!); gloomy and depressing casino area that smelled strongly of tobacco smoke (other places I visited had better Aircon I guess - I was less aware of the smell and the general feel was less claustrophobic; grumpy service staff; rooms started to look a bit shabby, a d while ok in terms of cleanliness - not up to normal US standards.

We were looking for a centrally located hotel, on the strip for the best value. TI fit the bill. We shopped on line through the different travel apps, and checked hotel sites directly. Ti was the best value beating similary reviewed properties by $400 for a holiday weekend. The room was fine, hotel services good. The pool was in full use and never seemed crowded. TI is attached to the MIrage by a tram so we enjoyed all the amenities of Mirage conveniently. What sets this property appart is the gaming staff. Warm, welcoming, customer service focused, they made our time at the tables, fun and exciting. Members of our party were first time craps players. The dealers and box made their first rolls memorable. One remarked he had been intimidated by the attitude of Atlantic City dealers, but would return to TI and recommend it to others. On the down side,,,,, the food was terrible. We gave up on the restaurants and ate at other venues.	4	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

Overall I was happy with the whole experience.<br/><br/>The hotel isn't one of the cheaper ones on the strip but it is worth the extra money for the location but if you are on a budget I am not sure that staying at TI would be any better than the Luxor.<br/><br/>The hotel itself isn't one of the larger ones so there aren't the facilities that you find in the likes of MGM or the Luxor eg there wasn't really places for late night snacks, bars for a quiet drink etc but it also meant that there wasn't the constant noise and bustle which was great for us.<br/><br/>There area couple of restaurants in TI that are good - the one we thought was exceptionally good was the Indonesian one....brilliant noodle dishes and a welcome alternative to burgers and steaks!!<br/><br/>The rooms were perfectly adaquate - nice size and all the usual things that you would expect.....I am not sure that it is the best value for money room on the strip though. The view from the room are great - we were on the strip and could see all the way along....that was worth the extra money we paid as the windows were massive so great view to go to sleep/wake up to.<br/><br/>The gambling was fine - again not the biggest casino but everything you wanted was there and the staff were helpful.<br/><br/>I think it is better suited for couples of a group of people who have been to vegas before and who don't want something that it 24/7 or aggresively party focused.	3	5	-1	3	5	5	-1	4

The service we received at the counter was fast and courteous.<br/>Unfortunately the elevators were not working upon our arrival so we did have to wait awhile before entering our room. Though we received a non-smoking room the previous guests had taken the liberty to forget. We contacted the front desk and was advised that they would only be able to change our room the following day. <br/>As promised we received our new room the following morning. It was quiet and nice.<br/>We ate at both restaurants in TI (breakfast dinner place &amp; the Vietnamese restaurant). <br/>The food was average and moderately priced.<br/><br/>One thing I noticed the night of my arrival, there were a lot of people in TI with no shoes on.....is it just me? <br/><br/>Unfortunately we were unable to see the pirate show as it was too windy that day and was cancelled.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend Treasure Island but only if you get a good deal.	4	5	-1	4	3	3	-1	4

The accomodations were more than adequate; rooms were well furnished and attractively decorated, beds supremely comfortable and bathroom clean and well-appointed. The only negative, housekeeping-wise, was that the carpet could have used a good cleaning. Noise from the hallway was a distraction, as was the street noise (sirens, etc) even though our rooms were on the 21st floor.

It's right in the middle of the strip with many walkways to the mall and nearby hotels (Wynn, Venetian etc.). The price was half the cost of nearby hotels. You get a good discount if you buy tickets for Le Mystere at their box office. (Don't call the box office number because they clearly had no clue and refused to honor the discount.)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>I had so many issues with this hotel since the moment I booked. I didn't get any email confirmations despite calling a second time and asking them to resend it. The check-in process was the worst I've seen at any hotel. I stood in line for 45 minutes to check in and it wasn't even during a peak time. When my key card didn't work, the concierge desk was closed (it was 6 pm!!) and they tried to tell me to go stand in the check-in line which was again about an hour long. The internet was down and when I called the front desk, I was routed to 3 different people who all told me different things (a few hours to 3 days to fix). Finally the manager told me that it would be working within a few hours. Of course when I got back to the hotel later that night, it still wasn't working. To top it all off, the bathtub was clogged when I tried to shower. It was over 100 degrees in Vegas and we were tired and wanted to shower and sleep. It took 45 minutes for the maintenance person to unclog it and then he left the bathtub a dirty mess. I asked to have it cleaned and was told that it was shift change for the cleaning staff so it would take a while. I actually had to haggle to have it cleaned, as if they were doing me a huge favor. In the morning, I called and talked to the manager about these issues and we were ugraded to a room with a view in a different tower that wasn't having internet issues. <br/>Considering the other options in Vegas, I would definitely pay more next time (and book earlier) so I won't have to stay at this hotel again. I recognize that maintenance issues happen from time to time, but it was the unapologetic attitude of the staff that bothered me the most. I do not think that wanting a tub that doesn't clog and internet that I'm paying for is too much to ask!	3	5	-1	2	2	1	-1	3

We booked 4 rooms for our party. When we checked in, I told the woman at the front desk that we were there for a bachelorette party and she comped us a bottle of champagne for each room - score! So we got checked in and I was told that there was a $28 resort fee per room per night. That was fine and totally what I was expecting. <br/><br/>We had a great trip. The hotel is in a great location in the middle of the strip. Rooms are average, pool is fun, but nothing special, but for the price I wouldn't expect much more. Oh, and there's a mechanical bull at one of the bars in the hotel. That alone makes me want to give TI 5 stars. But, alas, I can't. The cleaning service was pretty dismal. The beds were poorly made, the towels weren't always replaced, and we had to call several times, to both cleaning and room service, to get some used glasses removed. However, the cleaning part didn't bother me as much as it bothered others in my group. If my experience with TI had ended there, I would have gladly recommended this hotel and say for the price, you can't really beat it.<br/><br/>But then I got home and looked at my credit card statement. I had three extra charges in the amount of $224 from TI. One of the charges I was able to remove quite easily. I just called TI and they realized they had double charged the resort fee for one of my rooms. But the other two charges have been a hassle to remove. I've called TI a couple of times and I've been told the other charges are credits to my account or that it's just a holding charge and it will be removed. Umm, no. These charges have not been removed. I finally just disputed the charge through my credit card company. Hopefully this will take care of it.<br/><br/>I really liked staying at TI, but I won't stay there again because of their shady overcharging.	5	5	-1	3	2	3	-1	3

They have always treated me very well. <br/>We use valet parking, which can be a bit crowded, but the bell service is always good.<br/>If you come in the back way from Spring Mountain Road off Hwy 15 you can avoid the strip traffic during crowded times.<br/><br/>My rooms are comped and if I come during the week they give us a Petite Suite, which has two bathrooms and a hot tub on my wife's side. The room was spotless and had a beautiful strip view towards the Mirage this time. Hint: Either check in before or after the 11AM check out time.<br/>It is very crowded from 1030 to 1130. We use the invited guest line, but it was still crowded.<br/>No resort fees if the room is comped, but if you use the net in your room it is 14.99 per day. So do your wi-fi elsewhere.<br/><br/>We only ate at Kahunaville for breakfast which is great-3 egg special for $6. Cantor's deli had gotten a little high with $15 for a burger. But the custard is great if you want a dessert.<br/><br/>This casino is great if you want to visit Fashion Show Mall or Tix Tonight for show bargains.<br/>We got a ticket bargain for Vegas the Show, which I reviewed separately.<br/><br/>It is also the best casino in Las Vegas for comps. They give me $325 or more of free play each trip, and I am not really that high of a roller. They also give me major discounts on Oleksandra Spa which my wife said is very good and reasonably priced.<br/><br/>The pool is nice and much less crowded in the mornings and opens at 8AM. But beware of weekends, as the party crowds flow in. But very entertaining if you like to people watch.<br/><br/>I will always come back to TI because it was convienent to the stip and gives us such great comps.<br/><br/>Final Hint: Take the tram to the Mirage and see the Dolphin Habitat, they have four new baby dolphins which are very playful.<br/><br/>Big Jim	5	5	-1	5	5	5	-1	5

The check in line was pretty long and took about a half hour to check in. I think the hotel casino area smells more like smoke that many other strip casinos. We had a room on the 32nd floor facing north toward the Trump Hotel and the Fashion Mall. I think high rooms are quieter than the lower ones because the streets are close to the hotel. The room was average sized and clean. It had a refrigerator which is unusual for Las Vegas. They didn' clean our room prior to our last night at the hotel so we called and at least got clean towlels. I leave a small tip for housekeeping each day so this surprised me.<br/>The resaurants and bars are ok at TI nothing special. We were disappointed with Senior Frogs after trying it twice for drinks. The hotel pool area is fairly small for the hotel size, but wasn't very busy the 2 days we went there. They have bar service but not food. <br/>The hotels $25 per night service fee seems like a rip off. You get internet in room service, can print boarding passes and a few coupons but that is about it. I know MGM properties also have a service charge, but Harrahs properties do not at the current time.<br/>Overall suggestion when going to Las Vegas take half the clothes you were going to take and twice the money. Most name bars and restaurants are expensive. Look for coupons on line before going to help cut the cost of drinks. There are some 2 for 1 coupons out there, plus others.	3	3	-1	3	4	3	-1	3

Our first 'surprise' was the $ 25 per night 'Resort Fee' on top of our pre-paid booking - what a ripoff ! Our flight got us in early 9:00 AM and while we did not expect to get into a room we couldn't even do the check in process. When we returned at 11:00 AM there was a very long line and only 3 people checking in people while the hotel had 5 people assigned to check out for a short line - It took an hour + to get to the front desk to check in! We understood that this was a busy holiday weekend, however, a hotel knows its bookings and should adjust its staffing accordingly. <br/>Our room was very nice, comfortable and quiet. We like to hang out at the pool and Satuday was hopeless - the pool area was so crowded we gave up - <br/><br/>We had not stayed at TI for at least 10 years and will be going back to Harrah's owned properties in the future.	2	3	-1	5	5	2	-1	5

Service on the other hand was lacking. Bars closed in the evening, you can't get a drink unless you stamp your feet, and then they want a tip - for what? The porters demanded tips and one claimed to have a bad back and found it hard to lift my case and made a real fuss - so I deliberately didn't tip and he got really shirty. Another refused to take my case until I gave him a tip. The restaurants were good value and gave you more than you could realistically eat. The bars were more suited to a younger crowd and were very noisy with DJ loud music and not for a quiet drink and chat. But there are quiet bars nearby if you look. However, having said all of that - at $72 per night with a 'strip' view and great central location, you couldn't do better if you tried - so, great value.	4	4	-1	4	4	2	-1	4

We were here for five nights and were satisfied with the resort. None of us gamble, we are business travelers, so my review only covers the accomodations and not the casino.<br/><br/>If I have one complaint about Treasure Island it's the $25.00 resort fee tacked on to the nightly rate. We're here on a business trip and don't take advantage of any of the items this fee covers except for printing off our boarding passes when we leave. Even so, this resort fee isn't hidden. It's plainly disclosed, so we knew we had to pay the fee when we booked our room.<br/><br/>Our room was spacious, even for three people. The bathroom was adequate. Lots of counterspace which is good when you travel with a teenage daughter! I like the queen sized beds, especially since I had to share with my daughter this time.<br/><br/>On our last visit our sleep was disturbed more than once by our drunk neighbors. Unfortunately it happened yet again, but thankfully only one night this time. Thank goodness for foam earplugs. Other than that, noise was not an issue.<br/><br/>We ate one dinner at the hotel in the buffet restaurant. The food was standard buffet fare. Nothing spectacular but it was reasonably priced, hot and plentiful. Our waitress kept our drinks refilled and we were all satisfied at the end of our meal.<br/><br/>We also stopped at the Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream shoppe on site. The prices are high but the ice cream, oh so good! My sister and I shared the vanilla heath bar ice cream. It was delicious! Makes me hungry just thinking about it.<br/><br/>Another tip, if you're in a hurry and want Starbucks, there is a Starbucks located in the building by the Cirque de Soleil theater that has shorter lines than the outside location on the property. <br/><br/>Treasure Island is not the Ritz but they don't pretend to be. It's a reasonably priced hotel in a great location with decent accomodations and that is why we continue to return.<br/><br/>Happy travels!	4	4	-1	4	4	4	-1	3

All together it still came out to way more than I hope for and I am going to look for ways to cut costs next time I go to Vegas.I loved the show and the location of the hotel is great. The free Sirens show outside is pretty good too. The buffet is horrible DONT GO, but the coffee shop is good. The bed is really comfortable, loved it. We were on the 30th floor and for a couple of weeks I felt like everything was swaying back and forth. I did not get a chance to visit the pool.	2	5	-1	4	5	3	-1	5
UR139675420	4757C9197D782AF3E72411B3E06A047E	Treasure Island - TI Hotel & Casino	Las_Vegas_Nevada	2012-09-07	Disappointed First Timer	2	0	I wanted so badly to like this hotel/casino. I am still looking for &quot;my&quot; hotel in Vegas. I have been to the Flamingo, Mirage, MGM Grand, and now TI. Out of all of them, TI is last on my list. <br/><br/>I loved the room and the king-sized bed, but that is where it stops. I was extremely disappointed by the cleanliness in the hotel. I thought the casino and common areas were nice. Contrary to other reviews, I thought there was less smoking in this casino than in others. My room, however, was not clean. Upon arriving (and we arrived late at 6 PM, plenty of time to clean the room), I saw a stain the comforter, water ring on the right side bed table, and red blood-like spots on the shower curtain. I didn't want to complain (although I probably should have), and I thought it would be cleaned the next day when they weren't rushed. It wasn't. The only thing that changed was the water ring had been wiped away. Everything else stayed. I also never received a towel mat until the last day of our stay. Needless to say, I did not tip housekeeping. <br/><br/>The service I received at check-in was not great either. I thought 4-star hotels treated all their guests with good service. This was not my experience. I got the usual &quot;what size bed do you want, when are you staying, do you know about the resort fee&quot;, etc. I kept waiting for him to ask what brought us to Vegas. We were celebrating our birthdays, and we were staying here for the first time. I was thinking about paying for an upgraded room, but with the cold attitude I received, I didn't feel like asking. I felt like I was bothering the employee instead of being a guest. I realize that they probably only care about those that spend money in their casino &amp; restaurants, but as a new customer, shouldn't they be trying to get my repeat business instead of waving me off as someone not worth their time? Check-out was better, but of course by that time, it's too late. <br/><br/>The only time I received good service in this hotel was with the front desk when I called to report a light out in my room and to get help with the Internet connection. That service was prompt, courteous, helpful, and professional. They made me feel important, and in Vegas, that's what I'm looking for. <br/><br/>Also, for Labor Day weekend (August 2nd- August 5th), there were no $5 blackjack tables at any time. MGM even had $5 at one point during the week. The lowest I saw here was $10. <br/><br/>Next time I will stay at the Tropicana. They always have $5 blackjack tables.	3	4	-1	5	1	3	-1	5

I was very bothered by the way I was greeted when I first checked in. The lady that checked me in was not warm or welcoming at all. She did not make me feel as if TI was glad to have me as a customer. I was shocked to find out that I had to pay a $25 resort fee per day at the time of check in. If this is not an option, why isn't the $25 added into the fee of the hotel rate? The women checking me in made me feel an inch tall for even questioning the fee.She did not tell me any of the highlights this hotel has to offer. She did not thank me and she did not even tell me to enjoy my stay. <br/>My bath tub had black hair in the bottom of it. The shower walls are streaked with scum. The comforter was a wrinkled ball. The lighting to put my make up on was way too dim. I have been to Vegas many times. Both for business and pleasure and this was my first time staying here. I truly am dissapointed.	2	5	-1	2	3	1	-1	2

It's my goto hotel when I'm doing Vegas on a budget. Perfect location in the heart of the action on the strip. Great sky bridges to mall, Venetian and other locales. The rooms are &quot;ok&quot;;I like the fact that it's one of the few strip hotels without a prestocked minibar. You can actually store a bottle of water that doesn't cost $7!	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1	-1

The hotel lobby and casino are great, I booked TI based on that from my last visit. Resort fee a bit steep, but we wanted Wifi anyway so that got us some value, But it was the room, or the bathroom, that was the issue. Body hairs on the ceiling, and just an uncleaned feeling. In future I will use the venition, it is alot more expensive, but after a 10 hour flight from UK, I think I'll be glad I paid it.	3	4	-1	3	1	4	-1	4

Then when checking in, I was informed of the $25 resort fee, (for a prepaid reservation). NOT GOOD! But I agreed because I was sleepy and ready for my room - which was even more disappointing.<br/>Try a leaky toilet that disturbed my sleep during the night; a bathroom since that would not drain leaving a sink full of water, and very luke warm mater for an early (next) morning shower.<br/>All and all, that one day experience make me strike TI off my list of Vegas 'possibilities' in the future.	3	4	-1	3	3	3	-1	2

When you consider the price point &amp; location they're great. You can't beat the location on the strip. Right across the street from Venetian in between the mall &amp; Mirage. A ton is within walking distance. You could spend less at Excalibur, luxor, tropicana, or others, but you'll see a big difference. Rooms at MGM, Mirage, Ceasers are on par at a lot higher price. Rooms are mostly clean &amp; well maintained. I've stayed all over the strip &amp; keep going back because I can't find better for the $. Be warned though... They'll hit you with a hidden resort fee. It's not optional, but it does include Internet.	5	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4

I had to wait 15 mintues in line to check in. Not bad, Keep in mind they have thousands of rooms...lots of people to move. Staff was super nice and accomodating. I don't gamble so can't help ya there, but the buffet was great....espcecially the sushi and the home cooking. Walgreen is across the street. Nice tram shuttle to next door to Mirage if you need that. Rooms were clean, funny that the spa soaps were in the rooms to promote the spa, but the spa soaps were not wasted in the spa. Hum. Also, never had my laptop out of the case and they still charged me for 3 days of internet use ....I never even had the laptop on...why do they do this? That was $17 a day for 3 days, but luckily they just took it off, no questions asked. Seems like but of a racquet if you asked me, but no one asked me, so I'm a gonna tell ya anyway. Yes, I would easily stay ther again. I like it for the value.	5	5	-1	4	4	4	-1	4
